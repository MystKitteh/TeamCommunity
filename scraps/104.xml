                         This place was a great choice. The food 
                         is amazing. And such generous portions.

                         You know, Doug, most guys are put off 
                         by my eye. It's nice to finally meet 
                         someone who's open-minded.  Ew!

                         The female Leela's problem is purely 
                         medical. Soon she will drop her eggs 
                         and they will hatch and all will be

                         You just have to give guys a chance. 
                         Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's 
                         a pig. But then later you realise he 
                         actually has a really good body.

                         That's right. Animals in desperate need 
                         of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once 
                         filled with a super dense substance 
                         known as dark matter, each pound of 
                         which weighs over ten thousand pounds.

                         Well, dark matter is extremely valuable 
                         as starship fuel. That's why it was 
                         all mined out, leaving the planet completely

                         will kill all the animals.

                         Alright. We don't have much time to 
                         collect these animals. The planet is 
                         supposed to collapse in approximately 
                         two hours ago.

               find the purple fruit snake but it finds him first and eats him. 
               He stands up inside the snake and drags it back to the ship. 
               Fry tries to get the windy shrimp but it blows him away. Leela 
               tries to get the four legged mimic which looks like a horse but 
               copies people's heads and movements. Fry holds a net and tries 
               to decide which one is the mimic. Leela points at the mimic and 
               it points back at her. Fry looks...and throws the net over Leela. 
               Later, Leela ticks off the final animal on the checklist.</note>
 
               
               
               <note>Time Lapse. The checklist is filled. A small animal comes out 
               from behind some plants. It is mostly black, has one huge nostril 
               in the middle of its face and a three eyes, one of them on a 
               long stalk coming out of the middle of it's head.</note>

                         Certainly. But first you'll have to 
                         get rid of that thing.  That's the law, 
                         Leela. And Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's 
                         love: hard and fast!...

                         I would never abandon a helpless animal. 
                         Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were 
                         a big pompous buffoon. Then I realised 
                         that inside you were just a pitiful 
                         child. But now I realise that outside 
                         that child is a big pompous buffoon!

                         So this guy just unloaded a steaming

                         here. Bender, pick it up and put it 
                         in the engine.

                         We made it!  And some of the animals

                         So a couple of animals didn't die and
