                         And it was great! We got to see craters 
                         and rocks and that one incredible rock 
                         that looked like a crater and, and these

                         Fry, face it. The moon is a dump. It's 
                         a boring dried up wasteland. And the 
                         only reason anybody ever comes here 
                         is for the tacky little amusement park. 
                         Can't you just accept that?
