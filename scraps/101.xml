         (voice-over) Space. It seems to go on and on forever. But then you get to the
            end and the gorilla starts throwing barrels at you. </speak><note>A planet opens up and a
            huge gorilla starts throwing barrels at the spaceship. It dodges a few but one
            hits it and it explodes. The gorilla thumps its chest and "Game Over" flashes on
            the screen. The spaceship and gorilla isn't real and the man, called Fry, was
            playing an arcade game called "Monkey Fracas Jr". He is in his mid-20s, wears a
            red jacket and has orange hair with two distinct forks at the front. There is a
            little kid standing next to him. The game is against the wall in a pizzeria
            called Panucci's Pizza.</note>

         Hey, Fry. Pizza goin' out! C'mon!! </speak><note>Fry sighs, takes the pizza from him and
            walks out.</note> <note>New York Street. Fry cycles past people enjoying their New
            Millennium Eve. A cab pulls up and he sees his girlfriend inside.</note>

         Happy new year! </speak><note>Applied Cryogenics. Fry steps out of the elevator on the 64th
            floor. He knocks on a door marked Applied Cryogenics. A sign underneath
            indicates No Power Failures Since 199[7</note>. No one opens the door so Fry goes in.]
            <note>Cut to: Cryogenics Lab. The room is empty and there are no lights on. Strange
            pods about 6ft tall line one of the walls. There are a few other machines around
            the room and a desk and a chair in the middle of the room. Fry wipes some
            condensation from a window on one of the pods, revealing the face of an
            inanimate man inside. He turns around.</note>

         One! </speak><note>Cut to: Cryogenics Lab. Fry unenthusiastically blows a party blower and
            starts losing his balance on the chair. It tips back. Fry waves his arms around
            trying to regain his balance. As he falls he doesn't see the shadow of a small
            creature under the desk. The chair tips back and Fry falls off it and rolls
            backwards into cryogenic freezer number 40. The dial on the machine
            automatically sets itself for 1000 years.</note>

            1000 years later and the door opens. Fry is unfrozen. Initially disorientated,
            he stumbles around and notices something to his right. He presses his face
            against a large window and stares in awe.</note>

         No, I just work here. </speak><note>Fry looks out the window. A passing blimp wishes people

         I'm sure this must be very upsetting for you. 
    </section>
    <section>
        <character> FRY </character>
         Y'know, I guess it should be but actually I'm glad. I had nothing to live for
            in my old life. I was broke, I had a humiliating job and I was beginning to
            suspect my girlfriend might be cheating on me.

         Well, at least here you'll be treated with dignity. Now strip naked and get on
            the probulator. </speak><note>Probulator Room. Fry lies on a metal table surrounded by lots
            of things designed to probe him. Leela puts a single lensed goggle on and
            presses a button. Fry squeaks.</note> <note>Time Lapse. Leela tears off a printout and

         Y'know, I'm the luckiest guy in the whole future. I've been given a second

         Your permanent career assignment. </speak><note>She turns the screen around to show him his

        <character> LEELA </character>
         Well that's tough! Lots of people don't like their jobs but we do them anyway.
            You gotta do what you gotta do! Now hold out your hand, I'm gonna implant your
            career chip. It'll permanently label you as a delivery boy. </speak><note>She picks up an

         Whoa! </speak><note>Spaceships take off, there are traffic jams in the sky and billboards
            advertising Bachelor Chow. A couple walk past him nearly naked except for some
            strategically placed black bars. He looks up and sees people flying through a
            green tube overhead. He walks around a corner and finds an entrance to the tube.
            A pedestrian steps in.</note> MAN #1 JFK Jr. Airport. <note>The man is sucked up into the

        <character> FRY </character><speak>
         Cool! Um. Cross Town Express? </speak><note>The tube sucks him up and he screams as he flies
            through it. People look up from the street and stare at him. He is taken across
            the city, past the Statue of Liberty, underwater and finally out the other end
            smack into a building. A man looks up from his newspaper.</note> MAN #2 Pft! Tourist!
            <note>Time Lapse. A hover-car flies over a line of traffic on the road and a police
            car chases it. Fry walks around a corner and sees a line of people outside a
            small grey booth.</note>

         Shinier than yours, meatbag! </speak><note>Fry steps into the phone booth. He overlooks the
            important sign outside that differentiates it from normal phone booths. It is
            actually a suicide booth.</note> <note>Cut to: Suicide Booth. Fry presses a button and

         Of those poor sons of -- but that's not important. The important thing is I

         If by that you mean "transporting cargo" then yes. It's a little home business
