                         It really puts things in perspective. 
                         I mean, from up here an entire world 
                         can seem utterly insignificant.

                         Hey, nice seats! We're close enough 
                         to when you knock a player down with 
                         a beer bottle, he stays down.

                         Face it, Fry. Baseball was as boring 
                         as mom and apple pie. That's why they 
                         jazzed it up.

                         Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering

                         I'm glad you asked that question, Fry. 
                         You see, Chapek 9 was colonised centuries 
                         ago by a murderous crew of radical robot 
                         separatists.

                         Many said I was too extreme when I first 
                         called for the annihilation of the human

                         cunning monkeys. But after living on
