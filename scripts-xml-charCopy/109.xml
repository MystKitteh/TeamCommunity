<info>Opening Credits. Caption: Condemned By The Space Pope.</info>

<info>Madison Cube Garden. Fry, Leela and Bender are sat waiting for 
a Beastie Boys gig to start.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
This is awesome! I've been waiting a 
thousand years to see a Beastie Boys 
show.

<character>BENDER</character>
Can I get anybody a beer?

<character>FRY</character>
Sure!

<info>Bender opens his chest cabinet and uses his antenna to pump 
some beer into a cup. He hands it to Fry and Fry takes a gulp.</info>

<character>ANNOUNCER</character>
Ladies and gentlemen, here to lay down 
some old, old, incredibly old school 
beats: The Beastie Boys!

<info>A man wheels the Beastie Boys' heads in jars onto the stage. 
The crowd cheers. Some guys in black suits grab the jars and 
dance around. The Beastie Boys perform Intergalactic.</info>

<character>BEASTIE BOYS</character>
(singing) Well now don't you tell to 
smile

You stick around I'll make it worth your while

Got numbers beyond what you can dial

Maybe it's because I'm so versatile

Style profile I said

It always brings me back when I hear Wu Child...

<info>Leela looks at her wrist thing.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Impressive. They're busting mad rhymes 
with an 80% success rate.

<character>BENDER</character>
I believe that qualifies as ill. At 
least from a technical standpoint.

<info>Fry is standing away from them.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Will you guys shut up! I'm trying to 
look cool.

<info>He attempts to dance.</info>

<character>BEASTIE BOYS</character>
(singing) ...known for the Flintstone 
Flop

Tammy D gettin' biz on the crop

Beastie Boys know to let the beat...

<character>MIKE</character>
Drop!  Ow! How's it going?  Enjoying 
the show? Ow!  (shouting) Don't forget 
to pick up a T-Shirt!

<character>FRY</character>
Wow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come 
on guys. Tonight we're gonna party like 
its 1999...again.

<info>The Beastie Boys start to perform Super Disco Breakin.</info>

Beastie Boys (singing) Well it's 50 cups of coffee and you know 
it's on

I move the crowd to the break of break of dawn...

<info>Fry and Bender get into the mosh pit. Leela gets bumped around 
and doesn't look like she is enjoying herself.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Ow! Hey, watch it!

<info>She elbows someone in the face, kicks someone else, punches 
someone else the does a full circle flying kick and knocks everyone 
around her over.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The crowd are sat in their seats again.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Man, these guys rock harder than ever!

<info>The Beastie Boys sing Sabotage.</info>

<character>MIKE </character>(<character>SINGING</character>)
Oh my...

<character>MCA </character>(<character>SINGING</character>)
...it's a mirage...

AD-<character>ROCK </character>(<character>SINGING</character>)
...tellin' you all it's a...

AD-<character>ROCK </character>(<character>SINGING</character>)
Sabotage, yeah!

<character>MIKE</character>
Peace, we out!

<info>The crowd cheers and the Beastie Boys are wheeled out. Fry cheers. 
Enter a Fender amplifier who recognises Bender.</info>

<character>FENDER</character>
Hey, Bender!

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, Fender! Man, I haven't seen you 
since high school. You still workin' 
at Jack In The Box?

<character>FENDER</character>
Not anymore, baby. I'm with the band!

<info>Backstage. The Beastie Boys are getting head massages.</info>

<character>MIKE</character>
Aw! Oh, yeah!

<info>Enter Fender, Bender, Fry and Leela.</info>

<character>FENDER</character>
Hey, fellas, hey. I want you to meet 
my friends Bender, Fry and Leela.

AD-<character>ROCK</character>
Y'know we're, really not that interested 
in meeting them.

<character>FRY</character>
Wow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th 
century, I had all five of your albums.

AD-<character>ROCK</character>
That was a thousand years ago. Now we 
got seven.

<character>FRY</character>
Cool! Can I borrow the new ones? And 
a couple of blank tapes?

<info>Fender turns his volume down and turns to Bender.</info>

<character>FENDER </character>(<character>WHISPERING</character>)
Hey, Bender, why don't we ditch these 
organ sacks and hit the real party?

<character>BENDER</character>
Count me in! I'm gonna drink til I reboot!

<info>Room. Fender presses a button, a door slides open and in the 
room are three robots hooked up to an electricity thing. It shocks 
them and they groan.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, what kinda party is this? There's 
no booze and only one hooker.

<character>FENDER</character>
Don't be a drag, man. We're jacking 
on!  Aww yeah!  Wanna jolt?

<character>BENDER</character>
Uh hey, I'm no square but isn't that 
counter-indicated by my operations manual?

<info>The other robots laugh.</info>

<character>ROBOT</character>
Counter indicated!

<character>FENDER</character>
Come on, Bender, grab a jack. I told 
these guys you were cool.

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, if jacking on'll make strangers 
think I'm cool, I'll do it!

<info>He takes the plug and sticks it in his head. He goes crazy and 
starts to hallucinate. Sitar music plays. He falls onto a circuit 
board. Then he flies around a molecule and eats the electrons. 
He eats the proton and starts giggling. He dances with an electric 
eel. Fender takes the plug out.</info>

<character>FENDER</character>
Easy, baby. You don't wanna get hooked 
on this stuff.

<character>BENDER</character>
Eh, no need to worry. I don't have an 
addictive personality.

<info>He smokes a cigar, gulps down some beer and jacks on again.</info>

<info>New New York Street. The next day Fry and Bender walk around 
a slum. Hobos sleep in the travel tubes and windows are boarded 
up. Bender wears shades.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hey uh Bender. What are we doing in 
this bad neighbourhood?

<character>BENDER</character>
Shut up, square!  I'll just be a minute!

<info>Fry leans against a lamppost and whistles.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Three hours later Bender comes out. He walks weirdly 
and groans. He falls over, rolls off the pavement and lands face 
down in the gutter. A Preacherbot walks by and sees him.</info>

<character>PREACHERBOT</character>
Wretched sinner unit! The path to robot 
heaven lies here......in the Good Book 
3.0.

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey! Do I preach to you when you're 
lying stoned in the gutter? No! So beat 
it!

<info>Preacherbot tuts and walks off.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Who was that guy?

<character>BENDER</character>
Yo mama! Now shut up and drag me to 
work!

<info>Fry drags Bender by his legs.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Hermes addresses the staff with 
a chart.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Our electric bill's climbing faster 
than a green snake up a sugarcane. Obviously 
someone round been wastin' a whole heap 
a juice! Probably you!

<info>He points at Zoidberg.</info>

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Me?

<info>Enter Fry and Bender.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Good morning, Bender.

<character>BENDER</character>
None of your business, get off my back!

<info>He runs into the restroom.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
What's his problem?

<character>LEELA</character>
If I didn't know better I'd almost think 
he was abusing electricity.

<character>FRY</character>
Bender? No way!  I definitely would've 
noticed something.

<info>Leela gets up and knocks on the restroom door.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, why are you spending so much 
time in the bathroom? Are you jacking 
on in there?

<character>BENDER</character>
No! Don't come in!

<info>Enter Farnsworth with a box.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Good news, everyone! Today you'll be 
delivering a crate of subpoenas to Sicily 
8, the Mob Planet!

<info>Bender returns.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Alright, let's get to work! I'll be 
out in a second.

<info>He runs back into the bathroom.</info>

<info>Ships Cockpit. The crew have made the delivery and are returning 
to Earth.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I know Big Vinnie said he was giving 
me the kiss of death but I still think 
he was gay.

<character>LEELA</character>
Did he use his tongue?

<character>FRY</character>
A little.  You OK, Bender?

<character>BENDER</character>
None of your business! Get off my back!

<character>LEELA</character>
Uh oh. There seems to be some sort of 
electrical disturbance in the Coalsack 
Nebula.

<character>BENDER</character>
A what kind of disturbance?

<character>LEELA</character>
Electrical. Anyway it's going to take 
some careful piloting to avoid it.

<info>Bender sneaks out of the cockpit.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Ship. Bender opens the door and steps out. He 
edges his way around to the engines and pushes them so the ship 
flies straight towards the nebula. He laughs insanely.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Leela is struggling with the controls.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
We're out of control. We're heading 
straight into the electric field!

<character>FRY</character>
What's happening? I-I feel weird!

<info>The electricity has made his hair stand on end.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Ship. Bender stands on top of it in front of 
the gun turret, waving his arms.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Come on universe you big, mostly empty 
wuss! Gimmie all the juice you got! 
Oh, mama!

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. Bender sits atop the ship, melted to 
it. Amy drills him off with a jackhammer. He slides down the 
front of the ship and lands on the floor. Farnsworth, Leela and 
Hermes stare at him. Bender looks up at them.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
What?

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Bender has been repaired and a 
crate of spare robot legs and thighs is on the floor next tot 
he table.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, we didn't mind your drinking, 
or your kleptomania, or your pornography 
ring.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
In fact, that's why we loved you.

<character>LEELA</character>
But this electricity abuse crossed the 
line. You almost killed us.

<character>FRY</character>
And you made me feel like a jerk for 
trusting you. Just like when my friend 
Richie swore he wasn't taking drugs 
and then he sold me my mom's <character>VCR</character> and 
then later I found out he was taking 
drugs. You make me ashamed to be your 
friend.

<info>Bender sighs.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
You're right. I'm a lost cause.

<info>He walks out.</info>

<info>New New York Street. Bender walks past Sparky's Den sadly. He 
hears an organ play behind him and looks across the street to 
the Temple Of Robotology.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Maybe there's another way.

<info>Cut to: Temple Of Robotology Roof. Bender plugs himself into 
the neon sign and jacks on.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, yeah, that's the good stuff.  (crying) 
What am I doing? What have I become? 
Huh?

<info>He looks down though the roof and sees a sermon.</info>

<info>Cut to: Temple Of Robotology.</info>

<character>PREACHERBOT</character>
I see a lot of fancy robots here today. 
Made of real shiny metal. But that don't 
impress the Robot Devil, no, sir!

<character>ROBOT</character>
No, sir!

<character>PREACHERBOT</character>
'Cause if you're a sinner, he's gonna 
plug his infernal modem in the wall, 
belchin' smoke and flame. Amd he's gonna 
download ya straight to Robot Hell!

<character>ROBOT</character>
Straight to hell!

<character>PREACHERBOT</character>
So I ask ya: Who will stand up and be 
saved? Who? Who?

<info>The glass roof gives way and Bender falls through and lands 
in front of Preacherbot.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(weakly) Me.

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Hermes addresses the crew.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
And as a further cost-cutting measure, 
I have eliminted the salt-water cooler.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
This is a witch hunt!

<info>Enter Bender wearing a bow tie.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Oh, what a beautiful morning, 
oh what a beautiful day! (talking) Greetings, 
friends. Don't we all look nice today?

<character>FRY</character>
Great he's whacked out on electricity 
again.

<character>BENDER</character>
No, I'm whacked out on life. My friends, 
I found religion.

<info>The crew stare, shocked.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Religon? Is this another scam to get 
free yarmulkes?

<character>LEELA</character>
Give him a break, Fry. If this helps 
Bender clean up his act then I think 
we should be supportive.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yes.

<character>AMY</character>
Oh, yeah.

<character>HERMES</character>
Oh, yes!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Oh, yeah.

<character>BENDER</character>
Wonderful. Then you'll all come to my 
exceedingly long, un-air-conditioned 
baptism ceremony!

<info>The staff murmur.</info>

<info>Temple Of Robotology.</info>

<character>PREACHERBOT</character>
We are gathered here today to deliver 
brother Bender from the cold, steel 
grip of the Robot Devil unto the cold, 
steel bosom of our congregation.

<character>ROBOT #2</character>
Tell it, Preacher!

<character>ROBOT #3</character>
That equals true.

<character>PREACHERBOT</character>
Brother Bender, do you accept the principles 
of Robotology on pain of eternal damnation 
in Robot Hell?

<character>BENDER</character>
Yes, I do.

<character>PREACHERBOT</character>
Then I will now baptise you.  Press 
any key to continue.

<info>Bender presses a button and he is lifted and baptised in a barrel 
of High Viscosity Baptismal Oil. Preacherbot welds the symbol 
of Robotology - a resistor symbol - to Bender's chest.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Uh, while you're at it, could you touch 
up this seam?

<info>He raises his arm. Preacherbot welds the seam. Bender giggles.</info>

<info>Elzar's Fine Cuisine. The crew are dressed up.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
This is unbelievable. The old Bender 
never would have taken us out to dinner.

<character>BENDER</character>
The old Bender's gone. He won't trouble 
you anymore.

<character>WAITER</character>
Would monsieur care to see the wine 
list?

<info>Bender shreds the wine list and hands it back to the waiter.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
No poison for us, thanks. I'll stick 
with good old mineral oil.  Ah! Functional!

<info>Time Lapse. The food arrives.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Mon, I'm hungrier than a green snake 
in a sugar cane field!

<character>BENDER</character>
Friends! Friends! Surely you're not 
going to eat before we say Robot Grace? 
In the name of all that is good and 
logical we give thanks for the chemical 
energy we are about to absorb. To quote 
the prophet Jerimatic: 1000101010101...

<info>Time Lapse. The crew have given up and are anxiously waiting 
for Bender to finish.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
...0010110012. Amen.

<character>FRY</character>
Does that mean we can eat now?

<character>BENDER</character>
Yes.  But first, since I love you all 
so much, I'd like to give everyone hugs. 
Come here, Fry!

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, uh, but I don't want to.

<info>Bender hugs Fry.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Mmm! Mmm! Fry, you're my friend!  C'mon, 
everyone line up for a hug. Let's tear 
down some emotional walls.

<info>The others edge their seats away.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. Bender sticks something to the ship.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
What are you doing to my ship?

<character>BENDER</character>
Sanctifying it!  There! That ought to 
convert a few tailgaters.

<character>FRY</character>
Bender's stupid religion is driving 
me nuts.

<character>LEELA</character>
Amen.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
If only he had joined a mainstream religion 
like Oprah-ism or Voodoo.

<character>FRY</character>
We've got to get the old Bender back.

<character>LEELA</character>
And I think I know a way to do it. We 
have to reacquaint him with a little 
thing called "sleaze".

<info>Atlantic City Street. The ship lands in a car park.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The crew have taken Nibbler with them and they walk 
down the street.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I can't believe somebody hired an interstellar 
spaceship to deliver a package to Atlantic 
City. What are we delivering anyway?

<character>FRY</character>
Uh, this.

<info>He pulls some mints out of his pocket.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Where are we delivering it to?

<character>LEELA</character>
Uh, here.

<info>She takes the mints and puts them in a mailbox.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Another job well done. Now back to the 
office for an enjoyable evening of fasting 
and repentance.

<character>FRY</character>
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long 
as we're here why don't we take in some, 
exotic dancing!

<character>LEELA</character>
Hey, great idea!

<info>Bender turns around. He is standing outside a club called Power 
Strip. He gasps.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
But, those girls don't wear cases. You 
can see their bare circuits.

<character>FRY</character>
Come on, it'll be fun! Maybe we could 
even drink a little fortified wine.

<character>BENDER</character>
What?" Drinking wine is a sin. Even 
if it is deliciously fortified.

<character>LEELA</character>
Hey, Bender, looks at that woman's purse. 
It's hanging by a spaghetti strand.

<info>Bender zooms in but pushes his eyes back in again.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Thou shalt not snatch.

<character>FRY</character>
And there's Hookerbot 5000. She's got 
a heart of solid gold!

<character>HOOKERBOT</character>
Hey, sailing unit!

<character>BENDER</character>
Stop tempting me! For once in my life 
I have inner peace.

<character>FRY</character>
Pfft, that's for losers. C'mon, sin 
your heart out.

<character>LEELA</character>
Go nuts.

<character>HOOKERBOT</character>
Live a little.

<character>WOMAN</character>
Could you hold my purse for a minute?

<character>FRY</character>
Go for it, Bender. You know you wanna!

<character>BENDER</character>
Well...

<info>Power Strip. Bender dances with the Stripperbots and laughs.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm the greatest.  Woo-hoo!

<character>FRY</character>
Look's like we got the old Bender back!

<character>BENDER</character>
You know it, pork pie! Except for one 
thing.

<info>He rips the Robotology symbol off his chest and throws it over 
his shoulder. It sinks into a dish of stuff and beeps and glows.</info>

<info>Trump Trapezoid. Bender entertains three Fembots in the jacuzzi 
in his hotel room.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Y'know, as a major Hollywood director 
I'll be holding auditions tonight for 
my next movie. And even though you're 
all young and naive, I think you might 
just have what it takes.  Hey! I'm trying 
to score here! Can't you read the "Do 
Not Disturb" sign?  No! No!

<info>A pitchfork comes through the door and knocks him out.</info>

<info>Robot Hell. Bender wakes up. The Robot Devil welcomes him. He 
is a huge red robot with a tail and other things you might associate 
with the devil.</info>

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Greetings, Bender! Welcome to Robot 
Hell.

<info>Bender screams.</info>

<info>Trump Trapezoid. The next day Fry and Leela are in Bender's 
room. There are scorch marks where Bender fell and he has been 
dragged out of the room.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
What in hell happened to Bender?

<character>FRY</character>
Well he didn't check out. The ashtray's 
still here.  Look, Nibbler's caught 
the scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, 
boy. Follow that stench.

<info>The run out of the room.</info>

<info>Robot Hell Tunnel. Bender is chained to a cart and the Robot 
Devil stands behind him with a whip. The cart rolls down a track.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm hallucinating this, right?

<info>The Robot Devil whips him.</info>

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
No, Bender. Robot Hell is quite real. 
Here's our brochure.

<info>He hands Bender a brochure entitled Hell Is Other Robots.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
But I don't belong here. I don't like 
things that are scary and painful.

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Sorry, Bender, you agreed to this when 
you joined our religion. If you sin 
you go to Robot Hell - for all eternity.

<character>BENDER</character>
Aww, hell - I mean heck!

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
It's alright, you can say that here.

<info>Outside Reckless Ted's Funland. Fry and Leela look up at the 
sign.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Wait! I remember this place. They shut 
it down after all those people caught 
salmonella from the flume ride.

<info>Nibbler leads Fry and Leela to a ride called The Inferno.</info>

<info>Cut to: The Inferno. They open the door and look around.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Hmm. Look! It's the symbol of Bender's 
old religion.

<info>Fry presses the symbol and the crazy mirror beside it slides 
upwards. Behind it is Robot Hell.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Unbelievable. It's an actual, factual 
Robot Hell.

<character>LEELA</character>
Who would've thought hell would really 
exist? And that it would be in New Jersey!

<character>FRY</character>
Actually --

<info>A trap door opens beneath them and Nibbler watches them disappear 
down a twisting fun slide. They scream as they fall.</info>

<info>Robot Hell: Level 1.</info>

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
We know all your sins Bender and for 
each one we've prepared an agonising 
and ironic punishment. Gentlemen?

<info>A band of Hellbots start to play. Bender knows what is coming.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Aw crap, singing. Mind if I smoke?

<info>He lights a cigar but Beezlebot takes it from him and stubs 
it out on his chest. Two little robots throw him a hat and cane.</info>

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) Cigars are evil

You won't miss 'em,

We'll find ways to simulate that smell,

What a sorry fella,

Rolled up in smoke like a panetela,

Here on level 1 of Robot Hell!

<info>Bender falls through a trapdoor.</info>

<info>Cut to: Robot Hell: Level 2. He lands next to a card table. 
He picks the cards up and takes one from his chest cavity.</info>

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) Gambling's wrong and so is 
cheating,

So is forging phoney <character>IOU</character>'s,

Let's let Lady Luck decide,

What type of torture's justified,

I'm pit boss here on level 2!

<info>He spins a wheel that Bender is strapped to. Luck decides to 
deep fry Bender.</info>

(talking) Ooh! Deep fried robot!

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Just tell me why.

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) Please read this 55-page warrant.

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) There must be robots worse 
than I.

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) We've checked around, there 
really aren't.

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Then please let me explain,

My crimes were merely boy-ish pranks.

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) You stole from boy scouts, 
nuns and banks!

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Ah, don't blame me blame my 
upbringing!

<info>He steals Beezlebot's wallet.</info>

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) Please stop sinning while 
I'm singing!

<info>He pulls Bender's arm off and kicks him through a hole.</info>

<info>Cut to: Robot Hell: Level 5. Bender lands in front of the Beastie 
Boys. The Robot Devil picks Bender up by the leg and shakes him. 
Hundred of CDs fall out of his chest cabinet.</info>

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) Selling bootleg tapes is wrong,

Musicians need that income to survive.

<character>BEASTIE BOYS</character>
(singing) Hey, Bender, gonna make some 
noise,

With your hard drive scratched by the Beastie Boys!

That's whatcha whatcha whatcha get on level 5!

<info>Cut to: Robot Hell Slide. Fry and Leela slide further down.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
(singing) I don't feel well.

<character>LEELA</character>
(singing) It's up to us to rescue him.

<character>FRY</character>
(singing) Maybe he likes it here in 
hell.

<character>LEELA</character>
(singing) It's us who tempted him to 
sin.

<character>FRY</character>
(singing) Maybe he's back at the motel.

<character>LEELA</character>
(singing) Come on, Fry, don't be scared,

I'm sure at least one of us will be spared,

So just sit back, enjoy the ride.

<character>FRY</character>
(singing) My ass has blisters from the 
slide.

<info>Cut to: Elevator. Bender and the Robot Devil plunge into Hell. 
The Robot Devil takes stuff out of Bender's chest cabinet.</info>

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) Fencing diamonds,

Fixing cockfights,

Publishing indecent magazines...

<info>He kicks Bender out of the elevator.</info>

You'll pay for every crime,

Knee-deep in electric slime,

You'll suffer 'til the end of time,

Enduring torture's most of which rhyme,

Trapped forever here in Robot Hell!

<info>The music ends and the show finishes with a fireworks display.</info>

(talking) Of course that's just for starters.

<info>Fry and Leela fall from the slide screaming and land behind 
Beezlebot. They see him and gasp.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Bender, are you alright?

<character>BENDER</character>
No! Oh they're tormenting me with up-tempo 
singing and dancing.

<character>LEELA</character>
Alright, Beelzebot, what'll it take 
to get our friend back?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Sorry, but I hold all the cards here. 
There's nothing I can do. Now, if you'll 
just sign this fiddle contest waiver.

<info>Fry takes the pen but Leela stops him.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Wait. What fiddle contest?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
The Fairness In Hell Act of 2275 requires 
me to inform you that if you can best 
me in a fiddle contest, you win back 
Bender's soul. As well as a solid gold 
fiddle.

<character>FRY</character>
Wouldn't a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds 
of pounds and sound crummy?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Well it's mostly for show.

<info>He picks up the fiddle and it glints in the light.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
(whispering) Do you know how to play 
the fiddle?

<character>FRY</character>
(whispering) No, do you?

<character>LEELA</character>
(whispering) No, but I used to play 
the drums. They're sorta similar. (talking) 
What happens if we lose?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
You'll only win a smaller, silver fiddle. 
Also I guess I'll kill one of you, uh, 
him.

<info>He points at Fry. Fry gulps.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
We'll do it.

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Very well, then. Beat this.

<info>He plays a tune and uses his tail as an extra arm.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, we're boned.

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Your turn.  Ha!

<character>LEELA</character>
Time for the drum solo!

<info>She beats the Robot Devil over the head with the violin and 
he squeals like a little girl.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Run!

<info>They do. Hellbots and flying bugbots chase them. The bugbots 
shoot laser rings at them. Bender grabs a pair of a bugbots wings 
and flies in and grabs Fry and Leela who are swarmed by a crowd 
of Hellbots with pitchforks. Bender ascends and heads for small 
hole in the roof.</info>

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Stop them! They cheated!

<info>A bugbot shoots three laser rings at the trio. Two miss but 
one catches on Bender's antenna, forming a halo. The Hallejulah 
chorus plays and they get closer to the hole. Hellbots pull chains 
to close the hole.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Hurry, Bender!

<character>BENDER</character>
I could if you'd drop the stupid gold 
violin!

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, sorry.

<info>She drops it. It hits Beezlebot on the head. He squeals and 
Fry, Leela and Bender escape through the hole.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outisde The Inferno. They cheer.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Don't worry, guys, I'll never be too 
good or too evil again. From now on, 
I'll just be me.

<character>LEELA</character>
Uh, do you think you could be just little 
less evil than that.

<character>BENDER</character>
I don't know. Do you think you could 
survive a 700ft fall?

<info>Fry chuckles.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Good old Bender!

<info>THE END</info>

<info>The Beastie Boys perform a remix of the theme 
over clips from the episode.</info>
