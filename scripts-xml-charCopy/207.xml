<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry and Bender sit on the couch with 
their feet up on the table. There are crumbs, Chinese take-away 
boxes and a burger on the table. A creepy Twilight Zone-esque 
show starts on the <character>TV</character>. The opening titles are a star field background 
with various objects flying past the camera.</info>

<character>NARRATOR</character>
(voice-over; on TV) You're entering 
the vicinity of an area adjacent to 
a location.  The kind of place where 
there might be a monster or some kind 
of weird mirror.  These are just examples. 
It could also be something much better. 
Prepare to enter The Scary Door.  As 
per your request, please find enclosed 
the last man on earth.

<info>The camera stops moving. The man climbs some stairs into a public 
library. The scene moves inside where the man walks between the 
bookshelves.</info>

<character>MAN</character>
Finally, solitude. I can read books 
for all eternity.  It's not fair! It's 
not fair! Wait, my eyes aren't that 
bad. I can still read the large print 
books.  It's not f --! Well, lucky I 
know how to read Braille!  Hey, look 
at that weird mirror!

<info>Fry shudders.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Cursed by his own hubris!

<info>Enter Leela.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
There's a political debate on! Quick, 
change the channel!

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, that's what Fry said when we turned 
on the debate!

<info>Leela changes the channel herself. Two men who look remarkably 
alike stand at podiums. There are just two people in the audience.</info>

<character>ANNOUNCER</character>
(voice-over; on TV) C-<character>SPAN9</character> presents: 
The Thrill Of Politics.

<info>Fry and Bender snore. Leela sighs and slides Fry across the 
couch and sits between them. They wake up.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Look, I know there are no car chases 
but this is important. One of these 
two men will become president of the 
world.

<character>FRY</character>
What do we care? We live in the United 
States.

<character>LEELA</character>
The United States is part of the world.

<character>FRY</character>
Wow! I have been gone a long time.

<info>One of the candidates, Jack Johnson, begins the debate.</info>

<character>JOHNSON</character>
It's time someone had the courage to 
stand up and say: "I'm against those 
things that everybody hates".

<info>The other candidate is John Jackson.</info>

<character>JACKSON</character>
Now I respect my opponent. I think 
he's a good man but, quite frankly, 
I agree with everything he just said!

<character>FRY</character>
These are the candidates? They sound 
like clones.  Wait a minute. They are 
clones!

<character>LEELA</character>
Don't let their identical <character>DNA</character> fool you. 
They differ on some key issues.

<character>JOHNSON</character>
I say your three cent titanium tax 
goes too far.

<character>JACKSON</character>
And I say your three cent titanium 
tax doesn't go too far enough!

<character>FRY</character>
If I were registered to vote, I send 
these clowns a message by staying home 
on election day and dressing up like 
a clown.

<character>LEELA</character>
You're not registered?

<character>FRY</character>
Nope. Not vaccinated either! Besides. 
It's not like one vote ever made a difference.

<character>LEELA</character>
That's not true. The first robot president 
won by exactly one vote.

<character>BENDER</character>
Ah, yes. John Quincy Adding Machine. 
He struck a cord with the voters when 
he pledged not to go on a killing spree.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
But, like most politicians, he promised 
more than he could deliver.

<character>LEELA</character>
The point is, one vote can make a difference 
and even though it won't, I'm still 
taking you to get registered.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yes, that's a capital idea. Let's all 
go register.

<character>FRY</character>
Professor, when did you become so obsessed 
with voting?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
The very instant I became old.

<info>Citihall. Two banners have been hung outside, one saying "Voter 
Registration" and the other saying "First 100 Customers Get Extra 
Vote". The Planet Express staff stand in the middle of a room. 
On one side is Jack Johnson's party, the Tastycrats, and on the 
other is John Jackson's, the Fingerlicans.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
The problem with both parties is that 
they always want to give your tax dollars 
to the less fortunate.

<character>FRY</character>
The less fortunate get all the breaks!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
You know, Fry, you could join a third 
party, maybe.

<info>Amy scoffs.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Only weirdos and mutants join third 
parties.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Really? I'd better keep an eye out at 
the next meeting.

<character>FRY</character>
What party do you belong to, Bender?

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm not allowed to vote.

<character>FRY</character>
'Cause you're a robot?

<character>BENDER</character>
No, convicted felon.

<info>Time Lapse. Some of the other parties are the One Cell, One 
Vote party which is represented by two amoebae; the Green Party, 
represented by five green aliens and the Brain Slug Party, represented 
by two people with Brain Slugs on their heads.</info>

<character>WOMAN</character>
We favour unreasonably huge subsidies 
to the Brain Slug Planet.

<character>FRY</character>
OK, but what are the Brain Slugs who 
control you gonna do for the working 
man?

<character>WOMAN</character>
Attach Brain Slugs to them.

<character>FRY</character>
(sarcastic) Sure, you say that now!

<info>Amy looks at the Dudes For The Legalation Of Hemp party.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
So, is it true you can make all kinds 
of shirts and ropes out of hemp?

<character>STONED GUY</character>
Dave's not here, man.

<character>AMY</character>
I also heard hemp makes great shampoo.

<character>STONED GUY</character>
It does? No way! I gotta check out this 
brochure!

<info>He picks up a burger and munches on it. Farnsworth is over at 
the National Ray-Gun Association stand.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
So what are you doing to protect my 
constitutional right to bear doomsday 
devices?

<character>N.R.A. MAN</character>
Well, first off, we're gonna get rid 
of that three-day waiting period for 
mad scientists.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Damn straight! Today, the mad scientist 
can't get a doomsday device, tomorrow 
it's the mad grad student. Where will 
it end?

<character>N.R.A. MAN</character>
Amen, brother. I don't go anywhere without 
my mutated anthrax......for duck hunting.

<info>Zoidberg talks with a Neptunian at the People For The Ethical 
Treatment Of Humans stand.</info>

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Sure, humans are cute, but how else 
are we supposed to test cosmetics?

<info>Hermes has a Brain Slug attached to his head.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
I concur.

<info>Fry and Leela check out the Voter Apathy Party. The man sits 
at the stand, leaning his head on his hand.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Now here's a party I can get excited 
about. Sign me up!

<character>N.R.A. MAN</character>
Sorry, not with that attitude.

<character>FRY</character>
(downbeat) OK then, screw it.

<character>V.A.P. MAN</character>
Welcome aboard, brother!

<character>FRY</character>
(excited) Alright!

<character>V.A.P. MAN</character>
You're out.

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Bender, Fry and Leela are back on the 
couch.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
That was pretty cool. I think I'm actually 
starting to get interested in politics.

<info>Leela turns the TV on for the election coverage, presented by 
Morbo and Linda. Fry and Bender fall asleep. In the studio, there 
is picture of the hardhat guy giving a thumbs up with a question 
mark above him and "Decision 3000" below him.</info>

<character>LINDA</character>
And so, with two weeks left in the 
campaign, the question on everyone's 
mind is who will be the next president 
of Earth? Jack Johnson or bitter rival 
John Jackson? Two terrific candidates, 
huh, Morbo?

<character>MORBO</character>
All humans are vermin in the eyes of 
Morbo.

<info>Linda laughs.</info>

<character>LINDA</character>
In other local news, disaster struck 
on Saturn�s moon of Titan today, when 
a titanium mine collapsed, trapping 
1,000 robot workers.

<info>Bender wakes up.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
What? Lord have mercy!

<character>LINDA</character>
Unless something is done quickly, the 
trapped robots will be dead within 300 
years.  Sir, what rescue operations 
are planned?

<character>MINE SPOKESMAN</character>
The plan is basically to pave over 
the area and get on with our lives.

<info>Bender gasps. The picture cuts back to the studio.</info>

<character>MORBO</character>
News of the mines closing sent titanium 
prices skyrocketing.

<character>BENDER</character>
Alright! I'm rich!

<character>LEELA</character>
What are you talking about?

<character>BENDER</character>
My body's 40% titanium!  I'm finally 
richer than those snooty <character>ATM</character> machines.

<character>FRY</character>
Too bad you can't spend it.

<character>BENDER</character>
(ironic) Oh, can't I?

<character>FRY</character>
No.

<character>BENDER</character>
Watch me, poor man.

<info>Outside Rook Takes Pawnshop.</info>

<character>PAWNBROKER</character>
(from inside) Pleasure doing business 
with you.

<info>Bender laughs. The pawnbroker carries Bender's head out of the 
building and sets it down on the pavement. Bender is holding 
a wad of cash in his mouth.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Game's over, losers. I have all the 
money! Compare your lives to mine and 
then kill yourselves!  Hey, get away. 
Shoo! I'll give you five dollars to 
not do what you're thinking about doing. 
You just lost five dollars!

<info>Time Lapse. The dog has gone.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, buddy. Little help?  (shouting) 
Thank you!

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Farnsworth, Leela and 
Fry are sat around the conference table. Fry is eating a bowl 
of Bachelor Chow. Bender's head flies through the window, bounces 
off the screen and lands in the middle of the table.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hello, peasants.

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender? What happened to you?

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, you look different. Did you get 
a haircut?

<character>BENDER</character>
No, I sold my body.

<info>He spits the cash out of his mouth.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Sold your body? Oh, Bender, I've been 
down that road. I know it's glamorous 
and the parties are great but you'll 
end up spending every dollar you make 
on jewellery and skintight pants.

<character>FRY</character>
This is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna 
live without a body?

<character>BENDER</character>
Pft. Bodies are for hookers and fat 
people! All I need is a wad of cash 
with a head wrapped around it.

<character>FRY</character>
Well, at least now you can pay off your 
loan shark.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah, right. What's he gonna do, break 
my legs?

<info>He laughs.</info>

<info>Fancy Pad. Bender lives the high life. He sits on a lilo in 
a pool, reading Playbot with a lackey nearby.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Ah, this is the life. Another martini, 
please.

<info>Time Lapse. At the bar the man pours the drinks straight into 
Bender's head through his antenna hole.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Shaken, not stirred.  Aw, yeah!

<info>Casino. Fry and Leela join Bender for a game of Roulette.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Put it all on black.

<info>Fry slides Bender's chips down the table and knocks Bender onto 
the wheel. He bounces around on it before it stops. His antenna 
points to a number.</info>

<character>CROUPIER</character>
21 red.  I beg your pardon, 33 black.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yes! The rich get richer!

<info>Bowling Alley. The machine returns Leela's ball, which looks 
like an eye. Fry bowls Bender's head down the lane and it knocks 
down all the pins.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Strike! In your face, Leela!  Ow!

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Nibbler runs through a door flap being 
chased by Bender in a little car. Amy and Zoidberg dive out of 
the way of the car...</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. ...as Bender drives it 
through the doorway. He hits a gibbering Farnsworth in the shins.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Timber!

<info>Farnsworth falls over.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, Bender, can I take a ride in your 
car?

<character>BENDER</character>
Maybe if you clean up first. It looks 
like your neck stepped in something. 
Oh, I'm sorry, that's just your body!

<info>He laughs.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hey! You look me in the shins and say 
that.

<character>BENDER</character>
I've had it up to here with this place. 
I'm off to the Head Museum to hang out 
with classy heads like me who appreciate 
the finer things: poetry, philosophy, 
hats. So long, coffin stuffers.  Uh, 
could one of you coffin stuffers please 
carry me?

<info>Head Museum: Hall of Celebrities. Fry, Bender and Leela pass 
the heads of such movie stars as Charlie Chaplin, Jack Nicholson, 
Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Clint Eastwood, Leonardo DiCaprio, 
Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone; such B-movie stars as Mimi 
Rogers, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Elvis, Eric Stoltz and Martin 
Lawrence; such porn stars as Traci Lords, Ron Jeremy, Samuel 
Genitals, Jill Big Breasts and Long D. Silver and TV stars David 
Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Tim Allen, Jerry Seinfeld, Lucille 
Ball and Katey Sagal.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Now, which group of heads is good enough 
for me to hang out with? What do you 
think, Fry? Fry?

<info>Fry is talking to Claudia Schiffer's head in the supermodels 
section.</info>

<character>SCHIFFER</character>
Hi, I'm Claudia Schiffer's head.

<character>FRY</character>
I recognise you. Didn't you used to 
have a body of some sort?

<character>SCHIFFER</character>
Yeah, but it was holding me back. You 
know, I just did the cover of the Sports 
Illustrated Swimcap Issue.

<info>Fry purrs.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Well, you're looking great.

<character>SCHIFFER</character>
Thanks. I wouldn't mind losing a few 
pounds though.

<character>FRY</character>
Couldn't hurt.

<info>Head Museum: Hall of Presidents.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Ah, US presidents.  Sturdy shelves, 
good security.  This place has class.

<character>CLINTON</character>
(to Leela) Hey, sugar cookie. You know, 
legally, nothing I can do counts as 
sex anymore.

<character>FORD</character>
I apologise for his rudeness, ma'am. 
He gets this way around meaty-looking 
women.

<character>FRY</character>
(to Clinton) Hey, I remember you. I 
was gonna vote for you one time. But 
voting isn't cool so I stayed home alone 
and got trashed on Listerine.

<character>FORD</character>
Frankly, I've never felt voting to be 
all that essential to the process.

<character>NIXON</character>
No kidding, Ford.

<info>Bender tells Washington an anecdote.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
So then the hookerbot says, "That's 
not my expansion slot" and my friends 
says, "That's not my gold-plated 25-pin 
connector!"

<info>He laughs.</info>

<character>WASHINGTON</character>
Oh, Bender. Thou robots really cracketh 
me up.

<character>BENDER</character>
You know, I like it here. What's the 
rent on one of these jars?

<character>BUSH SR</character>.
Sorry, Bender, but we just can't allow 
every Tom, Dick, and Harry to move in. 
No offence, Jefferson, Nixon and Truman.

<character>CARTER</character>
Maybe Mr. Bender can get a spot in the 
closet of presidential losers.

<info>The closet is filled with the heads of Bob Dole, Lyndon LaRouche, 
Walter Mondale and Ross Perot as well as some cleaning supplies.</info>

<character>DOLE</character>
Bob Dole needs company. LaRouche won't 
stop with the "knock knock" jokes.

<character>BENDER</character>
Pass.

<character>WASHINGTON</character>
So, telleth, Bender. What hath happened 
to your body?

<character>BENDER</character>
I hocked it.

<character>WASHINGTON</character>
Hocked it? Why wouldst thou do that?

<character>BENDER</character>
Same reason you hocked your teeth.

<character>WASHINGTON</character>
Ah. Booze money.

<character>NIXON</character>
I remember my body; flabby, pastey-skinned, 
riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican 
body! God, I loved it.

<character>FRY</character>
I hear that. I spent most of my teen 
years loving my body. Course, it was 
tough love but -- ooh!

<info>Leela elbows him in the stomach.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Fry, he opened up relations with China. 
He doesn't want to hear about your ding-dong.

<character>BENDER</character>
So, Nixon. Even if you miss your body, 
being a head's great too, right?

<character>NIXON</character>
No, son. It's a sad and lonely life.

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, great. Now you tell me!

<character>NIXON</character>
That's my style. I like to kick 'em 
when they're down!

<info>Bender looks sad.</info>

<info>Robot Arms Apartments: Bender's Bedroom. Bender's head has a 
tiny bed and he is wearing a nightcap. He tosses and turns. He 
starts dreaming and 1's and 0's appear out of blackness.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(sleep-talking) Ones...zeros...one, 
one, zero, zero, one --

<info>The numbers appear faster and faster and he wakes up screaming. 
Fry opens the door.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Bender, what is it?

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoa, what an awful dream. Ones and 
zeros everywhere. And I thought I saw 
a two.

<character>FRY</character>
It was just a dream, Bender. There's 
no such thing as two.

<character>BENDER</character>
I know what this is about. My body loved 
me, and I turned its back on it. Well, 
old friend, tie a yellow ribbon round 
your neck, 'cause I'm a-comin' home!

<info>Rook Takes Pawnshop. The next morning, Fry and Bender are back 
at the pawnshop. There is a metal detector, a TV, some suitcases 
and a guitar in the shop.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
You sold my body? To who?!

<character>PAWNBROKER</character>
I can't reveal that information, but 
you look like a nice robot. Tell you 
what, I'll give you 50 bucks for the 
kid.

<info>He starts counting out some cash.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, my clothes are worth 50 bucks!

<character>PAWNBROKER</character>
Deal.

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry is sat on the couch stark naked 
with Bender, Leela and Farnsworth.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) Oh! How could I let this happen? 
I can't go through the rest of my life 
like this.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Don't you have a self-destruct button?

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) Yeah, but it's on my body. 
What am I gonna do?

<character>FRY</character>
Ah, I can't stand to see a robot cry. 
Let's watch TV!

<info>He turns it on. Richard Nixon's head is giving a press conference.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
And so, ladies and gentlemen, I'm throwing 
my head into the ring. I'm announcing 
my candidacy for the presidency of Earth.

<info>Cut to: Nixon's Press Conference. The reporters wave their hands 
in the air.</info>

<character>JOURNALIST #1</character>
Just one question.

<info>A man stands up.</info>

<character>CHANG</character>
Scoop Chang, Beijing Bugle. Sir, the 
constitution clearly states that nobody 
can be elected president more than twice.

<character>NIXON</character>
That's right, nobody.  But as you can 
plainly see, I've got a shiny new body!

<info>He starts dancing. His new body is Bender's old body, plus a 
new red tie.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Gasps aplenty.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh!

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, he's got your body!

<character>BENDER</character>
That dirty, double-crossing bastard! 
How dare he run off with Richard Nixon!

<info>Time Lapse. Fry has put on some new clothes.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Nixon must have bought your body from 
the pawn shop.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, and that electric guitar.

<info>Nixon plays Jefferson Airplane�s White Rabbit.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
(singing; on TV} Remember what the dormouse 
said

Feed your head.

(talking) I'm meeting you half way, you stupid hippies! <info>Cheers 
from the crowd.</info> I am not a crook's head!

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah you are, you stole my body! Fry, 
Leela, you gotta help me!

<character>LEELA</character>
Ordinarily I'd say no and lecture you 
on how this is your own fault for being 
such an idiot. But when a robotic Nixon 
is on the loose, we have a duty to take 
action. Idiot.

<info>Washington D.C. The Planet Express ship lands beside the Washington 
Monument and the much larger Clinton Monument.</info>

<info>Presidential Debate. Jack Johnson, John Jackson and Nixon are 
at the debate, headed by Morbo.</info>

<character>MORBO</character>
Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates: 
Puny Human #1, Puny Human #2, and Morbo's 
good friend, Richard Nixon.

<character>NIXON</character>
Hello, Morbo. How's the family?

<character>MORBO</character>
Belligerent and numerous.

<character>NIXON</character>
Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.

<info>He takes a baby out of his chest cabinet and kisses it.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Great. First he steals my body, now 
he's touching my stuff.

<character>LEELA</character>
Come on. We've gotta find some way to 
talk to him.

<info>They sneak out.</info>

<character>MORBO</character>
Morbo demands an answer to the following 
question: If you saw delicious candy 
in the hands of a small child would 
you seize and consume it?

<character>JOHNSON</character>
Unthinkable.

<character>JACKSON</character>
I wouldn't think of it.

<character>MORBO</character>
What about you, Mr. Nixon? I remind 
you you are under a truth-o-scope.

<info>The truth-o-scope hovers over Nixon's head and he starts to 
sweat.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
Uh, well, I, uh...the question is-is 
vague. You don't say what kind of candy, 
whether anyone is watching or uh... 
At any rate, I certainly wouldn't harm 
the child.

<info>The truth-o-scope beeps.</info>

<info>Nixon's Dressing Room. He squirts cleaner on his jar and rubs 
it. His campaign manager is with him.</info>

<character>CAMPAIGN MANAGER</character>
You scored big points tonight, sir.

<character>NIXON</character>
What are you talking about? They ate 
me alive out there.

<character>CAMPAIGN MANAGER</character>
Yes, but your body stayed on message. 
And that message is, "Look at my shiny 
new body". The robots ate it up. You've 
got real charisma from the neck down.

<character>NIXON</character>
Nixon with charisma? My God, I can rule 
the universe!

<info>Bender, Fry and Leela come out of a dirty laundry hamper.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Give me my body back you two-bit thief!

<character>NIXON</character>
Now look here, you drugged out communist. 
I paid for this body and I'd no sooner 
return it than I would my little cocker 
spaniel dog, Checkers.  Shut up, damnit!

<character>FRY</character>
Please, Mr. Nixon. We're appealing to 
your sense of decency.

<info>Everyone laughs.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
That was a good one!

<character>NIXON</character>
Seriously though, I'm never giving back 
this body. Now beat it! Before I get 
Cambodian on your asses!

<info>Fxjkhr Monument. Fry, Leela and Bender sit on the 60th president's 
monument. He was a huge monster, and his statue shows him devouring 
a person. There are skulls around his feet.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) It's hopeless. We might as 
well turn in my head for the five cent 
deposit.

<character>FRY</character>
No way! I'm not letting my best friend 
get recycled. Not for five cents, not 
for five hundred cents! Leela, I've 
got a plan!

<character>LEELA</character>
I've got a better plan.

<info>Outside Watergate Hotel. Fry and Leela, dressed in black, creep 
around the side of the building. The two carry a bag between 
them with Bender�s head inside. A searchlight moves past them 
and they freeze.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
(whispering) Why would Nixon stay at 
the Watergate?

<character>LEELA</character>
(whispering) They give you a discount 
if you've been here before.

<info>She shoots a grappling hook onto the roof. The hook scurries 
across the roof, wraps itself around a pipe and gives the rope 
a tug.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela hauls herself up the side of the building.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Keep going, we're right behind you.

<info>He's just holding onto her and letting her do all the climbing. 
Bender looks through a window.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoa, mama! Get a room, you two!

<character>MAN</character>
We're in a room!

<character>BENDER</character>
Well then lose some weight.

<info>Leela pulls Fry onto a ledge and they pull back some curtains. 
Nixon is asleep in front of a <character>TV</character>.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
(sleep-talking) Aroo!

<info>Cut to: Nixon's Hotel Room. Fry and Leela climb in.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
(sleep-talking) Oh, yeah. You women's 
libbers really know how to party!

<character>BENDER</character>
(whispering) Psst! There I am!

<info>Leela starts unscrewing Nixon's jar from Bender's body.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
(sleep-talking) Hey, Betty Friedan. 
Send a little of that lotion my way!

<character>LEELA</character>
OK, almost got it. Steady. Steady. Don't 
panic.

<info>Fry is lying on a bed, not listening. He looks at a box beside 
the bed marked "Magic Tentacles".</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Ooh!  Uh-oh!

<info>The bed starts to shake and the tentacles throw Fry around. 
Nixon wakes up and gasps.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
What the...?  You shaggy peaceniks have 
some nerve!

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm just here for what's mine. Don't 
make me kick your neck.

<character>NIXON</character>
Bring it on, soup can.

<info>They growl and start very slowly edging their way towards each 
other.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Alright, break it up, you two!

<info>She puts them on the couch.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
That's it. You're all going to jail. 
And don't expect me to grant a pardon 
like that sissy, Ford.

<character>LEELA</character>
You'll never pardon anybody because 
you'll never get elected president. 
The voters of Earth aren't the pea-brained 
idiots they were back in your time.

<character>NIXON</character>
Oh, no? Well, listen here, missy. Computers 
may be twice as fast as they were in 
1973 but your average voter is as drunk 
and stupid as ever. The only one who's 
changed is me. I've become bitter and, 
let's face it, crazy over the years. 
And once I'm swept into office, I'll 
sell our children's organs to zoos for 
meat and I'll go into people's houses 
at night and wreck up the place.

<info>He cackles.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Well, he lost my vote.

<character>NIXON</character>
Like one vote ever made a difference. 
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going 
to inch myself over to the phone and 
call the police.

<info>He starts hopping his way over.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Not so fast, Nixon! Are you familiar 
with audio tape?

<info>He rewinds a tape in his head.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
Uh-oh. I don't like where this is heading.

<character>NIXON</character>
And I'll go into people's houses at 
night and wreck up the place!

<info>He cackles.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
My God? I really sound like that? I 
thought my voice had more of a Clark 
Gable quality.

<info>Leela takes the tape out of Bender�s mouth.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
The jig's up, Nixon. We'll trade you 
the tape for the body.

<character>NIXON</character>
Oh, expletive deleted. You've got a 
deal.

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, I've got one last thought.

<info>The magic tentacles grab him and start throwing him around again.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry, Leela and Farnsworth are sat on 
the couch holding Earth flags. Enter Bender.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Ah, it's good to be back in one piece 
again. Except I can't get these damn 
bumper stickers off.

<info>He turns around and shows them his "Nixon's Head's The One" 
and "Impeach This!" bumper stickers.</info>

<character>LINDA</character>
The sheer drama of this election has 
driven voter turnout to it's highest 
level in centuries -- 6%

<character>MORBO</character>
Exit polls show evil underdog Richard 
Nixon trailing with an estimated zero 
votes.

<character>LEELA</character>
Yes! The system works!

<character>LINDA</character>
The time is 7:59 and the robot polls 
are now opening...and the robot vote 
is in. Nixon has won!

<character>LEELA</character>
No!

<character>FRY</character>
What?

<character>BENDER</character>
Get out of town!

<character>FRY</character>
Why would robots vote for Nixon now 
that he's just a head in a jar?

<info>Cut to: Nixon's Campaign Headquarters.</info>

<character>CAMPAIGN MANAGER</character>
I give you the next president of Earth!

<info>Nixon comes through the flag with his head atop a massive robot 
body. He steps on his campaign manager and crushes her.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
(shouting) Nixon's back!

<info>His robot supporters cheer.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I can't believe it. He won by a single 
vote.

<character>BENDER</character>
Well it ain't my fault. I'm a non-voting 
felon, thank you.

<character>FRY</character>
Well it's not my fault either 'cause 
I forgot to vote.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, crud. I knew there was something 
I meant to do today.

<character>MORBO</character>
Morbo congratulates out gargantuan 
cyborg president. May death come quickly 
to his enemies.

<info>Linda chuckles.</info>

<info>Washington D.C. Street. People run away as Nixon uproots trees 
and crushes cars to Hail to the Chief.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
Aroo! Who's kicking who around now? 
Aroo! Aroooo!

<info>Cut to: Outside White House.</info>

<character>NIXON</character>
Knock knock!

<info>He pounds down the wall with his fists, walks in and laughs.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
