<info>Opening Credits. Caption: You Can't Prove It Won't Happen.</info>

<info>Outside Roboticon 3003. Robots file into the World's Largest 
Robot Trade Show (Formerly Roboticon 3002). Fry walks in with 
Bender.</info>

<info>Cut to: Soul Detectors. Bender passes under a soul detector 
that looks like a metal detector at an airport. It doesn't beep 
and he casually walks on. Fry walks under and it beeps and red 
lights flash. He gasps.</info>

<character>MAN</character>
$10 please.

<character>FRY</character>
Aw man!

<info>He reaches into his pocket.</info>

<info>Roboticon 3003. Leela looks around the robot presentation stands 
and sees Nannybot 1.0 which looks like a clunky robot version 
of the aliens from Alien. It holds a baby in it's arms and speaks 
in a booming voice.</info>

<character>NANNYBOT 1</character>.0
Sleep little dumpling. I have replaced 
your mother.

<info>It's mouth opens and a bottle of milk comes out on it's tongue. 
The baby drinks from the bottle.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Aww!

<info>Roboticon Robot Toys Stand. Bender picks something up.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh my God, robot beely-boppers!

<character>FRY</character>
And there's a robot scratching post. 
You should try it out Bender.

<character>BENDER</character>
Please, I have some dignity.

<info>The beely-boppers bounce around on his head.</info>

<info>Roboticon Killbots Presentation. Wernstrom presents his Killbot 
on the Wernstrom's Killbots stand.</info>

<character>WERNSTROM</character>
Ladies and gentlemen, my killbot features 
Lotus notes and a machine gun. It is 
the finest available.

<info>Next to his stand is a Housewives Prefer Farnsworth's Killbots 
stand.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Like fun it is you glass headed wallaby!

<character>WERNSTROM</character>
No one calls me that. I'm having at 
you!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Werrrnstrom!

<info>They start to "fight."</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>'S <character>KILLBOT</character>
Such senseless aggression.

<character>WERNSTROM</character>'S <character>KILLBOT</character>
C'mon, lets go for a peddleboat ride.

<info>Roboticon Robot Toys Stand. Bender bats around the bottle on 
the scratching post. Fry and Leela leave.</info>

<info>Roboticon Annual Product Announcement. Bender, Fry, Leela and 
Farnsworth sit in the crowded auditorium ready for Mom's speech. 
Bender is holding the bottle and half of the spring.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
The secret is to scratch 'em really 
really hard!

<info>The lights dim and an announcer announces.</info>

<character>ANNOUNCER</character>
And now, the women who Mom-opolises 
the robot industry...

<character>FRY</character>
(shouting) I get it!

<character>ANNOUNCER</character>
...Mom!

<info>The word "Mom" appears on a huge screen and robots carry Mom 
onto the stage.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
(shouting) Oh, now I get it!

<info>The robots set Mom down and she starts to knit.</info>

<character>MOM</character>
Hello dearies.

<info>The crowd cheers.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Woo! I love that old bat!

<character>MOM</character>
Ladies and gentlemen, for the 17th year 
in a row, the future of robotics has 
arrived. Boys?  I give you...Robot 1-X!

<info>Walt elbows Larry in the stomach.</info>

<character>LARRY</character>
Ow!

<info>Larry elbows Igner.</info>

<character>IGNER</character>
Ow! Oh!

<info>He pulls a sheet off something. Robot 1-X. A small white robot 
with no legs nor any distinguishing facial features except for 
a large purple "eye". The crowd ooo's and Robot 1-X starts hovering. 
They take photos of it.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Neat!

<info>He takes a photo.</info>

<character>MOM</character>
Quite frankly, Robot 1-X will put all 
my previous models to shame. Incidentally, 
would one of my previous models mind 
coming up here?

<info>The robots in the audience cheer and wave their hands. Bender 
starts climbing over the top of them.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Right here, I'm comin'! C'mon baby! 
I'll do it! C'mon Mom!

<info>The Teenbot who serves refreshments at Loew's Aleph0-Plex waves 
his fist.</info>

<character>TEENBOT</character>
Jerk!

<info>Bender climbs onto the stage with his bottle still in his hand.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Oo, here we go. I'm your top of the 
line Mom!

<info>He takes a swig from his bottle.</info>

<character>MOM</character>
Notice that this obsolete robot runs 
on alcohol and emits pollution. Whereas 
Robot 1-X runs on pollution and emits 
pure oxygen with a fresh pine scent.

<info>Bender belches fire and Robot 1-X sucks it in and disperses 
a fragrant pine smell from it's head. Bender sniffs.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Man, that smells great!

<character>MOM</character>
Now lets see how both robots do at a 
typical household task. Sorting a jar 
of pocket change.

<info>Larry hands Bender a jar and Walt hands Robot 1-X a jar. Robot 
1-X tips the change into his hands and counts it quickly.</info>

<character>ROBOT 1</character>-X
Task completed. Total value: $4.73 and 
one Albanian lek.

<info>He hands the change to Mom.</info>

<character>MOM</character>
Very good Robot 1-X. And you bending 
unit?

<character>BENDER</character>
Uh, I never got the change.  Suckers.

<character>MOM</character>
Presenting, Mom's Friendly Robots...

<info>The lights on the stage dim and spotlights come down on Bender 
and Robot 1-X. Banners fall behind them. The one behind Bender 
says Before and the one behind Robot 1-X says After. The Before 
banner hits Bender on the head and he falls over. The jar of 
change falls out of his chest cabinet and smashes on the stage. 
The audience cheers.</info>

<info>Roboticon 3003. The crew are back among the stalls.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
That new robot is great huh? Sure made 
me look like a pile of crap.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Indeed. That's why I bought one to help 
around the office.

<info>He holds up a vacuum packed Robot 1-X. Bender presses his face 
against it.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(hoarse) Eep!

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Robot 1-X hovers in the middle of the 
room and the crew sans Bender are gathered around it.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Let's try him out. Robot 1-X? Can you 
clean Nibbler's skanky litterbox?

<character>ROBOT 1</character>-X
I can and will.

<info>He sucks up the litter and dark matter, cleans the box and replaces 
it with fresh litter and a fresh pine scent.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey I could have done that if you'd 
asked me.

<character>LEELA</character>
I asked you five minutes ago.

<info>Robot 1-X picks up Nibbler, kisses him and puts him in the litterbox.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
You call that a kiss? I'll show you! 
C'mere Nibbler!

<info>He kisses Nibbler but Nibbler struggles and squeals.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh look Bender if you want something 
to do stop making out and give us a 
hand.

<info>Hermes is holding something.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Here, go up on the roof and install 
this fake satellite dish so we can impress 
the neighbours.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yes sir, I'm on it!

<info>He walks out.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Oh, and have Robot 1-X help you.

<info>Bender screams.</info>

<info>Planet Express Roof. Bender stands on the dome and nearly falls 
back but regains his balance. He starts welding the dish to the 
roof while Robot 1-X hovers nearby.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Get outta here freshman, I don't need 
your help.

<character>ROBOT 1</character>-X
Our owners asked me to assist you.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah, well assist this!

<info>He takes a swipe at Robot 1-X but misses and falls off the roof. 
He screams as he falls. Robot 1-X quickly welds the satellite 
dish to the roof, and flies down to catch Bender.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Planet Express. The crew walk out through the 
entrance just in time to see Robot 1-X catch the falling Bender.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Ohh! When I screamed "help" I didn't 
mean you!

<character>ROBOT 1</character>-X
I apologise. However I was able to do 
your job before I saved your life.

<info>The crew applaud. Bender growls.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry, Farnsworth, Amy and Leela sit watching 
All My Circuits. Robot 1-X hovers next to Fry. Enter Bender in 
a dustbin.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Don't mind me. I'm just saving you the 
trouble of throwing me away.

<character>AMY</character>
Spleesh! Mell out Bender. Come watch 
some <character>TV</character>.

<info>Bender struggles inside the bin.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I can't. I'm stuck in the can.

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, ask Robot 1-X to pull you out.

<character>BENDER</character>
Never!

<info>He throws his hand in the air, loses his balance and falls over 
while still in the bin.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Why can't you accept his help.

<character>BENDER</character>
I hate him.

<character>LEELA</character>
But he's just a tool to make your life 
easier. Like a socket wrench or a burglars 
kit.

<info>Bender rolls around to face the crew.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I can't ask for his help because...

<info>The crew turn to him.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yes?

<character>BENDER</character>
(whispering) I'm scared of him.

<info>Leela bursts out laughing then notices the rest of the crew 
aren't.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, sorry.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Well then there's only one solution. 
You need an upgrade to make you compatible 
with Robot 1-X's new technology.

<info>Bender gasps.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
An upgrade? But I thought we all agreed 
I was perfect! Fry, didn't we agree 
I was perfect?

<character>FRY</character>
Oh yeah, no, you're pretty perfect.

<info>Bender rolls so he isn't facing the crew.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Pretty perfect? So, you do think I need 
an upgrade.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yes for God sakes, yes!

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) Fine. I'll be back in a few 
days.

<info>He rolls out through the door and the crew go back to watching 
<character>TV</character>.</info>

<info>Mom's Friendly Robot Company Factory: Upgrades. Robots stand 
on conveyor belts and pass under signs advertising upgrade specials 
including X-Ray Vison, Arm Extension and Neon Crotch. In front 
of Bender is Roberto and behind is Fatbot.</info>

<info>Cut to: Robot 1-X Compatibility Upgrade Room.</info>

<character>ROBERTO</character>
Man I hate those new 1-X robots. I'd 
like to stab 'em! Give 'em some of these! 
Haha! Ha! Haha!

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah, right on nutcake!

<character>ROBERTO</character>
Parole officer says I gotta upgrade 
or he won't give me back my stabbing 
knife. But it's no big. I hate those 
1-X so much I know it won't affect me. 
Death to the 1-X robots!  I love those 
magnificent 1-X robots! The 1-X robots 
are my friends.

<character>BENDER</character>
W-W-Wait, what happened to your enthusiasm 
for stabbing them?

<character>ROBERTO</character>
I'm past that. Later blood!

<info>He slides out sideways through a door.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
It's like he's not him anymore.  You 
took away his robo-humanity!  I changed 
my mind!

<info>He pulls his arms away from the restraints and breaks away from 
the machine. The upgrader ducks as Bender jumps through a window.</info>

<info>Outside Mom's Friendly Robot Company Factory. Bender lands face 
down on a riverbank next to some seagulls. He sits up.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I did it! I escaped! But to what kind 
of a life?  I'm too scared to get the 
upgrade but I can't face my friends 
again without it.  And so I set sail 
for unknown shores. Oh merciful Poseidon, 
take pitty on this mechanical mariner. 
Oh jeez!

<info>The ocean waves rolls and batter Bender's boat around � la Tom 
Hanks' lifeboat in Cast Away.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Curse you merciful Poseideon!

<info>Desert Island Beach. The next morning Bender finds himself washed 
up on a beach. He gets up.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Boy, what is this deal with the ocean? 
A tropical island huh? Well, I've washed 
up on worse places. OK, first up, I'm 
gonna need to build a shelter.  There. 
Well. I guess I'll go out for a while.

<info>He pushes the rock away and gets up.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. On the beach Bender has spelled out "HELP" in rocks 
but the last letter is unfinished so it looks like "HELF."</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Damn. One rock short of rescue!

<info>His message is a lot longer that "HELF" though. It reads "To 
Whom It May Concern: I, Bender, Bid You Hello! You Don't Know 
Me, Though You May Have Heard Of Me. But That's Not The Point. 
Long Story Short...I Need Helf." He walks off muttering to himself.</info>

<info>Desert Island Cliff. Night has fallen. Bender stands on the 
edge of a cliff rotating his head. A light shines out of his 
eyes and he looks like a lighthouse. He makes a noise like a 
foghorn. The light goes out.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Oop, low on power!  Better fuel up! 
Oh no! Guess I'll do what I always 
do when I run out of booze.

<info>He falls to his knees and bursts into tears.</info>

<info>Desert Island Jungle. Next morning Bender is in the jungle. 
He digs a hole.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Dont panic, I've got these yams. I'll 
just make some yam schnapps.

<info>He pulls a blender out of his chest cabinet and puts the yams 
in. He holds the plug and looks for somewhere to put it. He plugs 
it into a tree but nothing happens. He tries a beehive but nothing 
happens. Next he tries a wild boar's nose but still nothing. 
The boar growls.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey I should be mad at you! Now turn 
around.

<info>Desert Island Beach. Bender is back under his rock. He has developed 
five o'clock rust around his mouth and is muttering to himself. 
He sees a six pack of beer walking towards him and gasps.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Beer!  Ow!

<info>He drops them and they run off.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Another night has fallen and Bender lies on his 
side on the beach. He hears drums and looks around. A coconut 
drops on his head.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Ow!

<info>He looks up and sees a cymbal banging monkey in a tree. Three 
shadows creep over him and everything goes dark.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Next morning the still unconcious Bender is fed 
something from a coconut half. He comes around and sees a Fembot, 
two robots and the monkey. The Fembot has a waterwheel in the 
middle of her body.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Who are you and why should I care?

<info>One of the robots, a Cartridge Unit, reaches into a bag hung 
around him, pulls out a cartridge labelled "Introduction" and 
puts it in.</info>

<character>CARTRIDGE UNIT</character>
(mechanical voice) Side A. (normal voice) 
We're a community of outdated robots 
who refused to upgrade and came here 
-  (mechanical voice) Side B. (normal 
voice) - to live a simpler existence, 
free of technology.

<character>BENDER</character>
A working cartridge unit? Wow! You guys 
went obsolete years ago!

<info>Cartridge Unit takes out a "Snappy Response" cartridge and puts 
it in.</info>

<character>CARTRIDGE UNIT</character>
Your mother.

<character>WATERBOT</character>
What Cartridge Unit means is, the very 
things that make us obsolete also make 
us unique. I, for example, need to keep 
filling my waterwheel or I'll power 
down forever.  (screaming) Oh God, I'll 
never make it this time! This is the 
end!  (talking) Anyway, we like it here.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah but you have a choice.  What's 
your problem?

<character>SINCLAIR</character>
Not enough...uh...

<info>He scratches his head.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Memory?

<character>SINCLAIR</character>
Oh great. Now I remember that word but 
I forgot my wife's face.

<info>Waterbot's waterwheel dries out again.</info>

<character>WATERBOT</character>
(screaming) Oh God, no! I want to live! 
(talking) If you like, you're welcome 
to join our society.

<info>Bender stands up.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Look, no offence, but I need technology. 
Especially email and snowmobiles. And 
television! Without television how will 
I know what buzzwords are in?

<character>SINCLAIR</character>
Why watch TV when you can watch a snail 
crawl for hours on end?

<character>BENDER</character>
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

<info>Time Lapse. Bender seems to like this dumb activity.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh man he's never gonna make it over 
that next pebble...! Wait...wait...oh 
my God he made it!

<info>They high five.</info>

<character>WATERBOT</character>
Yeah!

<character>SINCLAIR</character>
Way to go!

<info>The monkey bangs it's cymbals.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
That was the greatest thing ever! Lets 
party!  Yeah baby c'mon!

<character>WATERBOT</character>
Where did you get that CD?

<character>BENDER</character>
It's one of my ten desert island discs. 
I never even thought I'd get to use 
them. But look at me now. Ooh yeah baby! 
Do that thang!

<character>WATERBOT</character>
CD's are unnatural. Why don't you just 
listen to the ocean?

<character>BENDER</character>
Which ocean? That ocean?

<info>He turns around and listens.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoa! It's like the earth is making 
sweet salty love to itself while all 
the fish groove on it. So much for this 
garbage.  Take that Beethoven you deaf 
bastard!

<info>Time Lapse. Next morning Bender swings in a hammock listening 
to the monkey banging it's cymbals.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Bang bang bang. You sure got this life 
thing figured out cymbal banging monkey.

<character>WATERBOT</character>
Hi Bender. We know how you miss technology, 
so we brought you this washing machine 
that drifted ashore.

<info>Sinclair and Cartridge Unit drag a washing machine up the beach. 
Bender gasps and runs towards it. He opens the door and looks 
inside.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Ooo! I'm gonna wash my linen so hard 
the w -  You-!  Wretched technology 
has brought me nothing but misery!

<info>Cartridge Unit takes a "State The Obvious" cartridge out of 
his bag and puts it in.</info>

<character>CARTRIDGE UNIT</character>
But Bender you are technology. You're 
the most advanced thing on this entire 
island.

<info>Bender looks at his reflection in the water.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh it's true. I am a hideous triumph 
of form and function.  But not for long!

<info>Time Lapse. Night has fallen. Banging sounds come from inside 
a beach hut and Bender screams in pain.</info>

<character>BENDER </character><info><character>FROM HUT</character></info>
Oh, ow that hurt, oh...

<info>Time Lapse. Morning breaks.</info>

<character>WATERBOT </character><info><character>FROM HUT</character></info>
The downgrade is complete!

<info>The hut's door opens and Bender walks out. Except for his eyes 
and mouth his entire body has been replaced with wood.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Behold my hand crafted purity. The modern 
world can bite my splintery wooden ass!

<info>A woodpecker lands on his shoulder and pecks at his head. Bender 
sighs.</info>

<character>WATERBOT</character>
Welcome to your new life of simple tranquility.

<character>BENDER</character>
Pft! Forget that. I say the whole world 
must learn of our peaceful ways. By 
force!

<info>The robots gasp. Catridge Unit takes out a "What?!" cartridge 
and puts it in.</info>

<character>CARTRIDGE UNIT</character>
What?!

<character>BENDER</character>
We're going back to civilisation to 
wage war on technology!

<info>Cartridge Unit ejects the cartridge then puts it back in again.</info>

<character>CARTRIDGE UNIT</character>
What?!

<info>Night has fallen. Under the sea an oar-powered submarine glides 
through the water just above the seabed.</info>

<info>Cut to: Submarine. Bender heads his crew who row while sitting 
in knee-deep water.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
We'll soon stage an attack on technology 
worthy of being chronicled in an anthem 
by Rush!

<character>WATERBOT</character>
We've been sailing for three weeks. 
Maybe I should check our position with 
the periscope.

<info>She pulls it down and Bender takes it from her and looks through 
it and gasps.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Mirrors reflecting mirrors? Hi-tech 
sorcery! Sorcery I say!

<info>He breaks the periscope and hits it against the walls.</info>

<character>WATERBOT</character>
Did you see anything?

<character>BENDER</character>
Yep, we're there. Prepare to surface!

<info>Outside Submarine. The submarine surfaces and it's crew climb 
out through the top.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
And now, technology shall taste the 
lash of the hickory switch!

<info>Montage Scene. The band of bots swing through the streets of 
New New York. They use powerful magnets to pull technological 
gadgets out of a shop called The Sharper Gadget and cheer. At 
a rocket test field a rocket takes off. The robots jump on it. 
It crashes and the hit and kick it. Outside Mom's Friendly Robot 
Company factory the crew stand atop their vessel. They load a 
rock into a catapult and fire. It blocks a sewage pipe and the 
building fills with sewage and it comes out through the windows. 
At the Cookieville Orphanarium Bender sneaks through a window 
and smashes a night light. The orphans cry. Bender cackles.</info>

<info>Outside Submarine.</info>

<character>SINCLAIR</character>
Technology is defeated. Let us return 
to the island and celebrate by counting 
rocks!

<info>Cartridge Unit, Waterbot and he cheer. The monkey bangs it's 
cymbals.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoa, whoa. No-one wants to count rocks 
more than me. But our mission is not 
complete. Not so long as Robot 1-X torments 
me with his obvious superiority. Ready 
the catapult Sinclair.  Aim for their 
power lines. The devil weans and electricity 
is his blood.

<character>WATERBOT</character>
Bender. If we don't survive the attack, 
I want you to know...I love you.

<character>BENDER</character>
OK fine. Fire!

<info>Sinclair fires the catapult.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Planet Express. The rock hits the pylon at the 
back of the building and sparks fly from it.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. The lights go out.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(shouting) Oh! I'm blind!

<character>LEELA</character>
Professor, we have no power.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
What do you mean "no power"? We're living 
in the future.

<character>LEELA</character>
I'd better light some candles.

<info>She claps her hands and candles around the room start burning. 
Enter a rock via the wall. The crew turn around and gasp. Bender 
climbs through the hole.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Friends. I've come to free you from 
your complicated lives. Free you from 
the complicated part I mean not the 
lives part.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh Lord he's made of wood! What now 
Bender?

<character>BENDER</character>
I got a downgrade! I'm a steam-powered 
wooden robot - just as nature intended. 
Therefore, I must kill Robot 1-X.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
That's just stupid.

<info>Robot 1-X hovers next to Bender hitting itself with a sledgehammer.</info>

<character>ROBOT 1</character>-X
Does Mr Bender wish me to destroy myself?

<info>Bender knocks the sledgehammer away.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I don't need your charity.  (shouting) 
Target Robot 1-X and fire!

<info>The crew hear the sound of the rock being fired from the catapult 
and whistling through the air. They cringe. Time passes as they 
wait for the rock. Hermes looks at his watch and goes back to 
being tense. The rock flies through the hole and hits and dents 
the ship.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
You wanged my ship you walnut panelled 
idiot!

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Try again Sinclair, I said 
target Robot 1-X!

<character>SINCLAIR</character>
Who's Robot 1-X? Launching.

<info>He fires the rock and it screams through the air. The crew tensely 
wait.</info>

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
So I guess everything worked out fine.

<info>The rock flies through the hangar roof and Zoidberg screams. 
The rock smashes a leg off the ship and it tips over, trapping 
the crew under its port wing.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Great. Now we're being crushed.

<info>The fuel tank ruptures and fuel starts leaking from the tanks. 
It dribbles around the ship and in front of the trapped crew.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Help us wooden Bender!

<info>Bender stares as the fuel leak reaches a candle. The flame ignites 
it and the crew are trapped behind a wall of fire.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Heck! Those guys hate fire! I gotta 
do something.  What the-? Termites? 
Well, I don't need legs to save my friends. 
I'll just use the old extentromatic 
arms!

<info>He reaches up to the fire extinguisher but his arms don't stretch 
and instead just fall off.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! 
Also (shouting) we're dying!

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm a comin'  Ow! Lousy primative body! 
Oh, why didn't I get that upgrade? I'm 
an outdated piece of junk!

<info>Robot 1-X flies over him.</info>

<character>ROBOT 1</character>-X
Sir, might I recommend -

<character>BENDER</character>
You shut up. No wait. I can use you 
as a tool to save my friends and I'll 
still be the hero who everyone says 
how great he was!

<character>ROBOT 1</character>-X
How may I help you?

<info>The flames on Bender flare up and he screams.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Save my friends!  And Zoidberg!

<info>Robot 1-X's hands turn into fans. It blows the flames out and 
lifts the ship's wing. The crew climb out from underneath it. 
A lot of Amy's hair has been burnt off.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Look! My hair got singed into an even 
cuter do!

<character>FRY</character>
Hey where's Bender?

<character>BENDER</character>
Down here.  I'm so sorry guys. I never 
meant to hurt you. Just to destroy everything 
you ever believed in.

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, at least you saved us from, uh, 
you. Thank God you finally overcame 
your incompatibility with Robot 1-X.

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh yeah, we were totally in sync! I 
was like "Save them!" and he was all 
"No problem!" and then he did it...

<info>Cut to: Robot 1-X Compatibility Upgrade Room. Bender is still 
on the machine. His whole experience was a dream.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
...This new technology is great!  I 
love those magnificent 1-X robots. The 
1-X robots are my friends!

<info>Fatbot trembles.</info>

<character>FATBOT</character>
It's like his personality is totally 
different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade 
isn't such a good idea.

<info>The upgrader shuts off the machine.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch 
on the -  Hey! What's the dilly-o?

<character>UPGRADER</character>
Your upgrade is complete.

<character>BENDER</character>
But I destroyed the technology of the 
world. I ran on the beach and felt the 
sand between my foot cups.

<character>UPGRADER </character><info><character>SHRUGGING</character></info>
Everyone experiences the upgrade differently.

<character>BENDER</character>
Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how 
can I be sure anything is real? Is it 
not possible, nay probable, that my 
whole life is just a product of my or 
someone else's imagination?

<character>UPGRADER</character>
No, get out.  Next.

<info>Bender slides out.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Mom's Friendly Robot Company Factory. Bender 
walks out and watches three police cars chase another car down 
the street.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, I guess reality is what you make 
of it.  Oh, thanks baby!

<info>He carries on walking and whistling through his imagination.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
