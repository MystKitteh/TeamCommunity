[Opening Credits. Caption: Known To Cause Insanity In Laboratory 
Mice.]

[Planet Express: Balcony. Its a scorching hot day and the crew 
are standing on the balcony in swimsuits. Leela is standing by 
an empty kiddie pool.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Hurry up with the water, I'm steaming 
in my own shell I am, it's that hot 
it is!

[Leela rips open a packet of Instant Pool Water (Just Add Water 
- Dead Leaves Included.)]

<character>LEELA</character>
Heyya!

[She empties the packet into the pool and squirts it with the 
hose. The pool fills with water with dead leaves floating on 
top. Enter Fry and Bender.]

<character>FRY</character>
Man it's hot! (different voice.) How 
hot is it? (normal voice.) It's so hot 
I poured McDonalds Coffee in my lap 
to cool off.  Jonny Carson said it.

[Nibbler starts to drink the pool water.]

<character>LEELA</character>
No! Nibbler, don't drink the pool water! 
It's full of chlorine!

[Nibbler finishes off the water and belches a green gas - chlorine! 
Everyone except Bender coughs and falls over unconcious. Bender 
laughs.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Lightweights! Oh wait - chlorine!

[He instantly rusts and falls over.]

[Planet Express: Meeting Room. The crew are slouched around the 
table sweating. Farnsworth is attaching an old filmstrip to Bender.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Perhaps this movie will help us take 
our minds off the heat.

<character>BENDER </character>(<character>JITTERY</character>)
Focuuus!

[The movie is projected onto a screen with the title "Global 
Warming Or: None Like It Hot."]

[In the movie a little girl called Suzie walks out of an ice 
cream shop with a cone. It melts before she can take a lick. 
She cries. A man laughs. The regular filmstrip narrator walks 
into the frame.]

<character>NARRATOR </character>[IN <character>MOVIE</character>]
You're probably wondering why your ice 
cream went away. Well Suzie, the culprit 
isn't foreigners, it's global warming!

<character>SUZIE </character>[IN <character>MOVIE</character>]
Gwobal wappa?

<character>MAN </character>[IN <character>MOVIE</character>.]
Uh, yeah! Meet Mr Sunbeam. He comes 
all the way from the sun to visit Earth.

[As he speaks there is a scene of a sunbeam in a hat with a briefcase. 
It walks from the sun to Earth and raises its hat.]

[He walks away from the Earth but is stopped by gas things.]

<character>GAS </character>[IN <character>MOVIE</character>]
Not so fast Sunbeam! We're Greenhouse 
Gases! You ain't going nowhere!

[More gases arrive and they beat up Mr Sunbeam.]

<character>MAN </character>[IN <character>MOVIE</character>]
Pretty soon Earth is chock full of sunbeams......their 
rotting corpses heating our atmosphere.

[The gases laugh and the scene changes to a classroom.]

<character>SUZIE </character>[IN <character>MOVIE</character>]
How do we get wid of the gweenhouse 
grasses?

<character>NARRATOR </character>[IN <character>MOVIE</character>]
Fortunately our handsomest politicians 
came up with a cheap, last minute way 
to combat global warming. Ever since 
2063 we drop a giant ice cube into the 
ocean every now and then.

[The movie cuts to a shot of a giant ice cube being dropped into 
the ocean.]

<character>SUZIE </character>[IN <character>MOVIE</character>]
Just like Daddy puts in his drink every 
morning! (sadly) And then he gets mad.

<character>NARRATOR </character>[IN <character>MOVIE</character>]
Of course, since the greenhouse gases 
are still building up, it takes more 
and more ice each time.  Thus solving 
the problem once and for all.

<character>SUZIE </character>[IN <character>MOVIE</character>]
But...

[The movie quickly ends with the caption "The End."]

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, we just need one of those big 
ice cubes. Someone should call the losers 
who are supposed to deliver it.  Hello?

[Nixon's head appears on the screen.]

<character>NIXON </character>[ON <character>SCREEN</character>]
President Nixon here.  I'm hiring you 
losers to deliver the ice. And hurry 
up! I'm sweating like J. Edgar Hoover 
trying to squeeze into a new girdle!

[He cuts off.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
You heard the good news everyone! Save 
the Earth, et cetera et cetera!  Bye!

<character>FRY</character>
Wait! Where do we get the ice?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
The wha? Oh Halley's Comet of course. 
The only sufficient source of ice cubes 
that don't have bugs in them!

<character>FRY</character>
Wow! Mining a comet, that sounds fun!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yes there's no safer occupation than 
mining. Especially when you're on a 
snowball whipping through space at a 
million miles an hour!  Safe!

[Halley's Comet. The ship flies in for it's landing. It has a 
giant cup tied to it. It lands. The cargo lift comes down. Bender 
moves a piece of machinery off the ship and onto the comet.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Deploying ice drill.

[He presses a button. The machine sprouts legs and grows to the 
same height as the ship. A thing comes out of the top of it. 
It turns into and ice dispenser.]

<character>FRY</character>
Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the 
ice crushes you!  Yakov Smirnov said 
it!

<character>LEELA</character>
No he didn't.

[Bender pushes the giant cup onto the ice dispenser.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Activating ice drill.

[The drill drills through the surface. Only a bit of grit comes 
through the dispenser.]

<character>FRY</character>
Oh my God! It's out of ice! Like some 
outer space Motel 6!

[Leela gasps.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Completely out of ice?

<character>BENDER</character>
This could mean the end of the bana 
daquiri as we know it...also life.

[Planet Express: Lounge. The crew are still sweltering. On the 
TV Morbo's head is inflating and deflating.]

<character>LINDA </character>[ON TV]
With Halley's Comet out of ice, Earth 
is experiencing the devastating effects 
of sudden intense global warming.

<character>MORBO </character>[ON TV]
Morbo is pleased but sticky. The scorching 
heat has melted the polar ice caps causing 
floods of biblical proportions.

[The shot changes to a swamped city with an ark floating through 
it.]

<character>GAY SAILOR </character>[ON TV]
They called me crazy for building this 
ark.

<character>MAN </character>[ON TV]
You are crazy, you built it with same 
sex animal couples!

<character>GAY SAILOR </character>[ON TV]
Hey! There are parts of the Bible I 
like and parts I don't like.

[The shot changes to a live windmill landscape.]

<character>MORBO </character>[ON TV]
Direct your attention now to the African 
turtles seen here migrating to cooler 
homes in Holland.

[A turtle rolls onto the back of its shell and can't get up.]

<character>BENDER </character>(<character>CRYING</character>)
That poor turtle!

<character>FRY</character>
Bender? Are you crying?

<character>BENDER </character>(<character>CRYING</character>)
Uh no! Never!

[He wipes his eyes with windscreen wipers.]

<character>MORBO </character>[ON TV]
Morbo wishes these storward nomads peace 
among the Dutch tulips!

<character>LINDA </character>[ON TV]
I'm sure those windmills will keep them 
cool.

[Outside Planet Express. The crew sit on some steps. The temperature 
reaches 120 Farenheit.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Well everybody, I just saved a turtle, 
what have you done with your lives?

<character>HERMES</character>
You went all the way to Holland already?

[Bender points at his feet. He is wearing clogs. He dances.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender a turtle isn't yourself. Why 
do you care about it?

<character>BENDER</character>
Because I also care deeply of things 
that remind me of myself. Like poor 
little Shelly here.

[He strokes the turtle.]

<character>HERMES</character>
What could you possibly have in common 
with this walking soup mix?

<character>BENDER</character>
For one thing, we both have a tough 
outer shell.  But lead a rich, inner 
life. Also...well you know...

<character>LEELA</character>
You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, 
chain smoking gamblers?

<character>BENDER</character>
No! Its just...neither of us can get 
up when we get knocked on our back.

<character>FRY</character>
What? I've seen you get up off your 
back tons of times.

<character>BENDER</character>
Those times I was slightly on my side.

<character>HERMES</character>
Interesting. Maybe we should test this 
erectile disfunction of yours Bender.

[Everyone gets up and moves towards Bender.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Uh, that's not necessary, really! I 
think I hear my factory recalling me.

[Amy crouches behind Bender and he trips over her and he and 
the turtle land on their backs.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh! That's what I get for sharing my 
vulnerability with you people.

[A Civil Defence van drives past.]

<character>VAN</character>
Calling all scientists, calling all 
scientists. Be advised there will be 
a worldwide conference on global warming 
in Kyoto, Japan.

[A man runs to the van.]

<character>MAN</character>
I've got a degree in homeopathic medicine!

<character>VAN</character>
You've got a degree in baloney!

[The van sprays the scientist with a water cannon.]

<character>AMY</character>
Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Forget it, I'm not going! I have my 
reasons! Shut up all of you!

<character>HERMES</character>
Strange. You haven't acted suspicious 
since I found those "ape bones" in the 
basement.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking 
a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill 
out! I'm not just making excuses! Alright 
I'll go!

[Outside Conference Centre. Scientists from all over the world 
arrive. Photographers take photos of them and fans in the crowd 
wave papers for them to sign. Joan Rivers' Head is commentating 
the star studded event.]

<character>CROWD</character>
Oh God I can't believe it! I love you!

[Farnsworth steps out of a limo.]

<character>RIVERS</character>
Oh oh! It's Hubert Farnsworth! He's 
looking fab in a standard white lab 
coat and dark slacks! His wristwatch 
is Casio.

[Cut to: Conference Centre. The scientists are gathered in a 
huge room. The Civil Defence van pulls up on the stage.]

<character>VAN</character>
Thank you all for coming! It is my pleasure 
to introduce the host of the Kyoto Global 
Warming Convention, the inventor of 
the environment and First Emperor of 
the Moon - Al Gore!

[Al Gore's Head in a jar rises up from the middle of the stage.]

<character>GORE</character>
I have ridden the mighty Moon Worm.

[The audience goes wild.]

<character>FRY</character>
Good for him!

<character>GORE</character>
My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in 
my book, Earth In The Balance and the 
much more popular Harry Potter And The 
Balance Of Earth we need to defend our 
planet against pollution. As well as 
dark wizards.

[The audience cheers and a dark wizard who looks like Tim The 
Enchanter from Monty Python And The Holy Grail sulks.]

<character>DARK WIZARD</character>
Sure! Blame the wizards!

<character>GORE</character>
That's why I'm offering a bag of Moon 
Saphires to the scientist who can solve 
this problem once and for all.  Lovely 
aren't they?

<character>DARK WIZARD</character>
Sapphires?  With those I could open 
the Gate Of Kerash!

<character>GORE</character>
First up is Professor Ogden Wernstrom.

[Wernstrom walks onto the stage.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Wernstrom!

<character>WERNSTROM</character>
Ahem. Ladies and Gentlemen. I have placed 
in orbit a giant mirror that will reflect 
40% of the sun's rays. Thus cooling 
Earth. Observe.

[He presses a button and the roof opens up. The audience is blinded 
by the sunlight. Fry starts to pant.]

[Cut to: Space Mirror. The mirror moves around and starts to 
reflect the rays.]

[Cut to: Conference Centre. The room falls into shadow and Wernstrom 
dusts off his hands.]

<character>WERNSTROM</character>
Problem solved.

[He laughs.]

[Cut to: Space Mirror. A piece of debris hits the mirror. It 
starts to spin and reflects more sunlight onto the Earth in a 
concentrated beam.]

[Cut to: City Street. A man shields his eyes.]

<character>MAN</character>
Ooo, that's a little bright.

[The sunlight scorches the street and blows the man up.]

[Cut to: Conference Centre. The sunbeam cuts its way through 
the building. The audience run around panicking. Gore continues 
talking.]

<character>GORE</character>
Alright, What else we got?

<character>FRY</character>
Professor, you're a Professor. You must 
have some ideas.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've 
got nothing to hide!

<character>GORE</character>
Our next speaker is -

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I demand the floor!

<character>GORE</character>
Yes, it's your turn to speak.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage! 
I know the source of the greenhouse 
gases. But in my shame I've kept it 
secret for 75 long years. Ohhh, it haunts 
my memory still.

[He holds a ray gun up to his head.]

<character>FRY</character>
Professor no, don't do it!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Don't do what? Don't use this memory 
ray so I can remember what happened 
back then?

[He shoots himself. A blue glow envelopes his head.]

[Flashback - 75 years ago.]

[Mom's Friendly Robot Company: Farnsworth's Lab.]

[A prototype C3PO-like robot wakes up on the table. It looks 
around and sees Farnsworth.]

<character>PROTOTYPE</character>
Oh dear. Might I favour master with 
a tender kiss on the forehead?

[It kisses Farnsworth.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh dear, I've failed again.

[He presses a button and the robot is crushed � la the Terminator 
in The Terminator.]

<character>PROTOTYPE</character>
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

[Mom's Office. Mom is bashing Farnsworth's head on her desk.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Ooo, ouch, stop!

[Time Lapse. Farnsworth finishes making the first working robot.]

[The robot wakes up, drinks beer and belches fire.]

<character>MOM</character>
What was that?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
A flaming burp.

<character>MOM</character>
Does it always do that?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Its not always a burp. We still have 
one problem though. This robot will 
never meet emission standards.

<character>MOM</character>
Crap spackle!  We'll just call it a 
sport utility robot and classify it 
as a light truck!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Well...I suppose the environment can 
take one more for the team.

[He starts to clean the robot.]

[Mom lies on a table.]

<character>MOM</character>
Take me now you stud!

[He climbs on and they both...um. The robot carries on drinking.]

[Flashback ends.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh this is all my fault!

<character>FRY</character>
That's awful Professor. Especially the 
making out part.

<character>GORE</character>
Yeah, I didn't need to hear that.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
All modern robots descend from my original 
smog blasting designs. And that's the 
cause of global warming today.

<character>WERNSTROM</character>
Uh, so the robots are to blame. As I 
suspected.  We are left with only one 
possible course of action. Grim though 
it be.

<character>BENDER</character>
I got a good feeling about this!

<character>WERNSTROM</character>
We must immediately and permanently 
shut down, dismantle and destroy all 
robots!

<character>BENDER</character>
No!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Wait, surely there's a better -

[The Civil Defence Van interrupts him.]

<character>VAN</character>
The conference is over.

<character>GORE</character>
I must go now, to help collect cans 
on Jupiter. Peace out ya'll!

[His jar sprouts rockets and he blasts off.]

<character>AUDIENCE </character>(<character>CHANTING</character>)
Destroy all robots! Destroy all robots!

<character>AMY</character>
Poor Bender.

<character>FRY</character>
Be brave my friend.

[The turtle goes into its shell. So does Bender.]

[Planet Express: Lounge. Bender is still in his body. The crew 
are trying to coax him out.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Come on. You've got to come out of your 
chest sometime.  Would you do it for 
a Bender snack?

[She opens it and tempts him with it. He reaches out to grab 
it but the crew all grab his arm.]

<character>FRY</character>
Ah ha!

<character>LEELA</character>
Gotcha!

<character>BENDER </character>[<character>FROM INSIDE</character>]
Let me go! I don't even want the stupid 
beer!  Yes! You tried to trick me into 
coming out of my chest. But who has 
the beer now?  I've got mail.

[He reaches into his chest cabinet and pulls out a card with 
the words "It's A Party" on it.]

<character>AMY</character>
Ooo, it's a party. Apparently.

[Nixon's head appears in the card.]

<character>NIXON </character>[IN <character>CARD</character>]
Do you like to party? To boogie down? 
Well I'm throwing an all night beach 
raver for my robot pals. It all goes 
down Saturday on the isolated Galapogas 
Islands where there will be no escape 
- from the fun! All robots must attend!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Strange. Why would Nixon, an awkward, 
uncomfortabble man suddenly throw a 
party? One of the most social events 
imaginable. It's a trap is why! They're 
going to deactivate all the robots! 
I don't hear any gasping.

<character>LEELA</character>
We all figured that out.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Ohh!

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, I'm off.

[Fry blocks the door.]

<character>FRY</character>
Wait. We could hide you! We'll pile 
fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.

<character>BENDER</character>
No. I'm going to the party.

[Fry puts a banana skin on Bender's head.]

<character>FRY</character>
I won't let you.

<character>BENDER</character>
Fry, as you know, there are lots of 
things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, 
vengence, Father O'Mally's weedwhacker. 
But at long last I've found something 
I'm willing to die for. This mindless 
turtle.

<character>FRY</character>
Bender, this world isn't good enough 
for you.

<character>BENDER</character>
Not even close. Goodbye everybody. Don't 
touch my stuff after I'm dead!  (shouting) 
It's booby trapped.

[Robot Party. The robots party on a ship. Then they cross the 
desert on camels. Then they swing through a jungle. Then they 
go to a fair. Then they party on the Galapogas islands. Bender 
looks at his turtle.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if 
I had a drink.  Crummy kegg it's completely 
ta -  Oh you're a robot.

<character>KEGG</character>
Don't stop!

<character>BENDER</character>
Ew!

[Nixon takes the stage.]

<character>NIXON</character>
Attention happenin' robots. Who's got 
what it takes to party with Nixon?  
You fellas enjoy yourselves for the 
next two hours. And be sure not to leave 
the island, uh for at least two hours! 
I'm going out to pick up some smokes. 
Uh really good smokes! Two hours.  OK 
headless body of Agnoo, lets blow this 
joint!

[The body growls and carries Nixon to a helicopter. Bender watches 
the helicopter fly away.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Nah, I'm not really in the -

[She shakes him around. Bender panics.]

[Nixon's Helicopter. It is now flying through space towards Wernstrom's 
mirror.]

<character>WERNSTROM</character>
Per your orders I have modified my mirror 
to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse 
at the Galapogas. Every robot will be 
instantly and painfully terminated. 
Now for your part of the bargain.

<character>NIXON</character>
Oh, very well. Agnoo, you belong to 
Wernstrom now.

[Agnoo growls.]

[Galapogas Islands. Bender is talking to his turtle.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I have to say goodbye now. There ain't 
not turtles where daddy's a-going. (whispering) 
Don't tell anybody but Nixon's about 
to shut all robots off and -

[A boom mic robot hangs over Bender.]

<character>MIC</character>
What??

[There is bedlam with the robots.]

<character>ROBOT #1 </character>(<character>SHOUTING</character>)
We're gonna die!

<character>ROBOT #2 </character>(<character>SHOUTING</character>)
Nixon's not bringing the smokes!

[Bender takes control.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Shut up and pay attention to me! Bender. 
Look, I love life and its pleasures 
as much as anyone here, except perhaps 
you Hedonismbot.  But we need to be 
shut off! Especially you Hendonismbot!

<character>HEDONISMBOT</character>
I apologise for nothing!

<character>BENDER</character>
We pollute too much. We're destroying 
the world and killing the turtles.

<character>PREACHERBOT</character>
To hell with the turtles!

<character>BENDER</character>
No one insults the turtles!

[He punches Preacherbot.]

<character>PREACHERBOT</character>
Oh mercy.

[He pulls out a knife and he and Bender fight.]

<character>HEDONISMBOT</character>
Let the games begin!

[It chuckles. The Planet Express ship flies in and lands. Fry 
and Leela carry the Professor out and stand him in front of the 
microphone on the stage.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Everyone listen!

[The robots stop fighting. Bender punches Preacherbot again. 
He falls over.]

<character>PREACHERBOT</character>
Aw damn!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I've devised a way to save you and to 
stop global warming at the same time! 
Granted you're all blasting out greenhouse 
gases.

<character>BENDER</character>
You're one to talk!

[Preacherbot hits him with a chair. He falls over onto his back. 
He tries to get up but can't.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
But we can use those very gases to save 
the planet. If you all vent your exhaust 
directly upward in one burst it should 
thrust the Earth further from the sun, 
thus cooling it.  By my calculations 
we'll need the full force of every last 
robot. So quickly, everyone point your 
exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now 
vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!

<character>FRY</character>
Why isn't this working?!

<character>LEELA</character>
Some lazy or polite robot is holding 
it in.

[Bender is still on his back, unable to vent.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Help! Help!!

[Cut to: Nixon's Helicopter. Wernstrom is turning the mirror 
towards the robots.]

[Cut to: Galapogas Islands. The robots continue to vent but to 
no avail.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
A billion robot lives are about to be 
extinguished! Oh the Jedi's are going 
to feel this one!

[Bender and the turtle are still on their backs.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm sorry buddy. At least we'll die 
on our backs, helpless.  Huh? What the 
hell are you doing?  Hey are you trying 
to make me look bad?  Ah ha! I'm even 
greater than I thought I was! And now 
to fullfill my destiny.

[He stands on his hands and vents. The flame grows bigger and 
the Earth moves.]

[Nixon's Helicopter.]

<character>NIXON</character>
Fire!!  What the??

<character>WERNSTROM</character>
We missed.

[Agnoo growls.]

[Galapogas Islands. The skies have cleared and the crew are standing 
on the stage. Nixon is with them.]

<character>NIXON</character>
Professor, for saving the Earth and 
foiling me, I proudly, yet angrily, 
present you with Earth's new highest 
honour: The Polluting Medal Of Pollution.

[He hangs the medal around Farnsworth. The industrial chimneys 
on the medal blow smoke in Farnsworth's face making him cough.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Thank you. I deserve this!

[The robots cheer.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey Professor! Now that the Earth's 
orbit is further from the sun won't 
that make the year longer?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Why yes! One week longer to be exact.

<character>NIXON</character>
In that case I hereby declare it Robot 
Party Week!

[The robots cheer and dance to Buster Poindexter and his Banshees 
Of Blue's Hot Hot Hot. Then they vent.]
