<info>Opening Credits. A remix is performed by the cast in their character 
voices. Caption: Controlling You Through A Chip In Your Butt 
Since 1999.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. All My Circuits is on the <character>TV</character>.</info>

<info>Calculon sits at his desk in his office with his face buried 
in his hands. His son Antonio sits on the other side. Weepy soap 
opera music plays.</info>

<character>CALCULON </character><info>ON TV</info>
Why Antonio?

<info>Very dramatic music plays. The previously montage fades to a 
bedroom where Monique has yet another passionate affair with 
Boxy. Enter Calculon. Monique pulls the sheets over her.</info>

<character>MONIQUE </character><info>ON TV</info>
Calculon?! But I thought you were -

<character>CALCULON </character><info>ON TV</info>
Egyptian?!

<info>More dramatic music. The scene changes to Monique and Antonio 
on a yacht. Monique is pointing a laser at Antonio.</info>

<character>MONIQUE </character><info>ON TV</info>
Before I kill you, I must ask you one 
question. Who am I? For I have...amnesia!

<info>Even more dramatic music. The scene changes to a room. Monique, 
Antonio and Human Friend sit on a couch and two other robots 
stand behind. Calculon stands in front looking at them all.</info>

<character>CALCULON </character><info>ON TV</info>
Let me get this straight. Does anyone 
here not have amnesia?

<info>The rest murmur in confusion.</info>

<character>MONIQUE </character><info>ON TV</info>
Not sure.

<character>HUMAN FRIEND </character><info>ON TV</info>
I 'unno.

<info>And the same dramatic music. In the Planet Express lounge Cubert 
and Dwight are sat watching All My Circuits with Fry, Leela and 
Bender.</info>

<character>CUBERT</character>
This show is awesome! When I grow up 
I'm gonna have so much amnesia!

<character>DWIGHT</character>
Me too. I mean, I have it now, but I 
forgot.

<character>CUBERT</character>
Well mine's louder!

<character>BENDER</character>
Cram a ham in it you twerps!  Sorry!

<character>FRY</character>
Nah, I had it coming.

<info>On the TV Calculon's birthday party is in full swing.</info>

<character>CALCULON </character><info>ON TV</info>
Welcome swingers. Pull up a groove and 
get fabulous!

<character>MONIQUE </character><info>ON TV</info>
Nude rocks bands, big piles of what 
I assume is talcum powder, it's quite 
a birthday party Calculon.

<character>CUBERT</character>
Cool! I'm gonna have a fabulatious birthday 
party just like Calculon!

<character>DWIGHT</character>
Oh yeah? Well I'm gonna show up looking 
good. Just like Monique.

<character>LEELA</character>
Do you two have to imitate everything 
you see on TV?

<character>CUBERT</character>
Um, we're 12, so, yes.

<character>DWIGHT</character>
Hold up Cubert, you're a clone of the 
Professor. Do clones even have birthdays?

<character>CUBERT</character>
Well duh!

<character>DWIGHT</character>
"Duh" what?

<info>Cubert looks puzzled.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Farnsworth and Hermes, wearing 
goggles and gloves, poke something in a crate with rakes. Enter 
Cubert and Dwight. Hermes puts the lid on the crate.</info>

<character>CUBERT</character>
Dad? Do I have a birthday?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Hmm, you didn't have a birth so technically, 
no.  Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate 
the day I extracted you from the cloning 
tank. Or the day I scraped that <character>DNA </character>
from that growth on my back.

<character>CUBERT</character>
Ooo, that one!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Ah yes. It was 13 years ago next week. 
I used this very fork.

<info>Hermes takes it.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Aww well isn't that - ew!

<info>He drops it when he realises what he is saying.</info>

<character>DWIGHT</character>
Hey, next week'll be my birthday too.

<character>HERMES</character>
That's true. If only there were a way 
to have one party for both of you here 
at the office then write it off as a 
business expense. Wait! I thought of 
a way! The way I just said!

<character>CUBERT</character>
Yeah!

<character>DWIGHT</character>
Way to go pops!

<info>They hug their dads.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Cubert and Dwight run back in 
and leap on the couch. On the TV Calculon and Monique are bathing 
in some pink stuff.</info>

<character>CALCULON </character><info>ON TV</info>
Oh Monique, why did we wait so many 
years to bathe in champagne?

<info>He scoops some up in a glass and drinks it. Antonio comes crashing 
in through the ceiling wearing a parachute. He hits the ground 
with a thump.</info>

<character>ANTONIO </character><info>ON TV</info>
Father, I've discovered the shocking 
secret mother has kept from you for 
200 years.

<character>MONIQUE </character><info>ON TV</info>
No! No!

<character>ANTONIO </character><info>ON TV</info>
Brace yourself. For when I speak these 
words you may well suffer an attack 
of explosive amnesia. For you see, the 
horrible secret is -

<info>He stops talking and starts to fizzle. His pupils go crazy and 
he starts groaning. Monique and Calculon glance at each other 
in confusion.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoever's directing this is a master 
of suspense!

<info>Cut to: All My Circuits Soundstage. Antonio fizzles on the set 
while Calculon and Monique are still in the tub. Sal and two 
other guys walk onto the set. Sal hits Antonio twice with a hammer 
then leans on him and talks to the other two.</info>

<character>SAL</character>
He's busteds. Lets get hims outta heres.

<info>They pick him up and carry him away. He continues groaning.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. The TV changes to static then 
a still image of a robot with one of his eyes popped out and 
the message "Oops! Broken Actor."</info>

<info>The TV cuts into the episode. The Hypno-Toad does nothing except 
sit, hypnotising his audience.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
This show's been going downhill since 
season three.

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. A "Happy Growth-Scraping Day" 
banner has been strung up along the back wall. LaBarbara and 
Amy fly up to the ceiling on rocket packs and hang streamers. 
Enter Zoidberg in tramp garb.</info>

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Look who's here everyone! It's Zoidberg, 
the lovable tramp!

<info>Hermes, Leela, Farnsworth, Cubert and Dwight applaud.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Since when are you performing at children's 
parties?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Performing? What? Please, if someone 
could spare me money to buy shoes -

<info>The five look away and Zoidberg sighs.</info>

<character>DWIGHT</character>
This party pukes.

<character>CUBERT</character>
Yeah! The guests were supposed to be 
here three hours ago.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Well that doesn't mean that no one is 
coming and that you two are total losers. 
Who gave you that idea?

<info>The doorbell rings.</info>

<character>DWIGHT</character>
All right! They must've all come as 
a group.

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. Cubert and Dwight stand by side 
door.</info>

<character>CUBERT</character>
Welcome swingers! Pull up a groove and 
get fabulous!

<info>He chuckles and opens the door. No one is there. He hears a 
squeaking and looks down. Tinny Tim hobbles towards the door 
with a green envelope.</info>

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
Good day fellows. Someone dumped this 
invitation in my begging cup. Happy 
growth-scraping day to all!

<info>Cubert and Dwight sigh.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The rest of the crew are gathered 
around with glasses and food. Hermes, LaBarbara and Farnsworth 
talk.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Fire 'em all.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Mm-hm, mm-hm.

<info>Cubert, Dwight and Tinny Tim sit around the table, bored. Enter 
Bender with the <character>TV</character>.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(gasping) Guys, guys something's happening 
on television again.

<info>He puts the TV on the table and plugs the plug into his ass 
socket. The TV flickers on just in time for Entertainment And 
Earth Invasion Tonite. Morbo and Linda sit in the studio. The 
studio backdrop features flying saucers hovering over the Hollywood 
sign.</info>

<character>MORBO </character><info>ON TV</info>
Welcome to Entertainment And Earth Invasion 
Tonite. Across the galaxy my people 
are completing the mighty space fleet 
that will exterminate the human race! 
But first, this news from Tinseltown.

<info>Footage of Antonio's breakdown appears behind Linda.</info>

<character>LINDA </character><info>ON TV</info>
Following Antonio Calculon Jr's breakdown 
on set, the popular TV show All My Circuits 
will hold an open casting call for child 
robots to replace him.

<character>BENDER</character>
An open casting call for child robots? 
Tinny Tim? Are you thinkin' what I'm 
thinkin'?

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
What's that sir?

<character>BENDER</character>
That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
You raised my hopes and dashed them 
quite expertly sir!  Bravo!

<info>Outside All My Circuits Casting Office. Bender, Leela and Fry 
sit in a room filled with childbots.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will 
only get you so far. There's a lot of 
famous child acting units here.

<character>FRY</character>
Look, there's Macaulay Culckon.

<info>He points at a spotty little robot whos hands are permanently 
attached to his face and has a permanent shocked expression like 
Macaulay Culkin's face in the posters for Home Alone and Home 
Alone 2: Lost In New York.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
He's just not cute since he got puberty 
installed.

<character>FRY</character>
Psst. There's that robot child actor 
who grew up an robbed a convenience 
store!

<character>LEELA</character>
And there's that robot child actor who 
grew up and became a convenience store!

<info>The robberbot puts some cash into the 7^11 vending machine.</info>

<character>ROBBERBOT</character>
Lottery ticket please.

<info>The 7^11 machine prints out the ticket. A woman walks out of 
the casting office.</info>

<character>CASTING DIRECTOR</character>
We're ready for the first audition. 
(reading) Emoteitron Jr?

<info>The robot gets up and his mother stops him.</info>

<character>MOMBOT</character>
Hold on precious, let's make you look 
nice for the lady.  What's this?  What 
did I tell you?  No more hanging wires!

<info>All My Circuits Casting Office. Emotitron Jr stands in front 
of the table where the casting director and Calculon are sat.</info>

<character>CASTING DIRECTOR</character>
In this scene, you've just found out 
your real father is Calculon's fourth 
evil identical septuplet, Sleazy Martinez. 
<character>OK</character>...take us there!

<info>The robot looks at his script.</info>

<character>EMOTITRON JR</character>
Now that I know the truth father, I 
must ride south and join the robo-banditos 
at Veracruz.

<character>CALCULON</character>
Well, I thought he was good but the 
audience seems to have turned on him.

<character>CASTING DIRECTOR</character>
But I don't think -

<character>CALCULON</character>
Next!

<info>Time Lapse. Night has fallen and Macaulay Culkon is auditioning.</info>

<character>MACAULAY CULKON</character>
...at Veracruz, so, if you'll kindly 
hand me my poncho -

<character>CALCULON</character>
Sorry kid you're flailing out there. 
90 actors and they all got boo-ed. 
I just wish we could get this Bender 
I keep hearing about. They say he's 
the greatest.

<character>CASTING DIRECTOR</character>
Well there is a robot named Bender here 
but he's much too old -

<character>CALCULON</character>
Send him in forthwith!

<info>Cut to: Outside All My Circuits Casting Office. Bender is right 
outside the door.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Boo! Not as good as Bender! 
Boo!

<info>The door opens and the casting director is standing there.</info>

<character>CASTING DIRECTOR</character>
Mr Bender?

<info>Bender screams.</info>

<info>All My Circuits Casting Office.</info>

<character>CASTING DIRECTOR</character>
Have you ever been on TV before?

<character>BENDER</character>
Once, when I took those hostages.

<character>CALCULON</character>
I saw that! You were good. Let's hear 
you audition.

<info>The casting director hands Bender a script. Bender thumbs through 
it.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Banditos eh? Aw this is great! 'Cause 
I happen to have a flawless Spanish 
accent!  (bad Spanish accent) I will 
say adios Padre! Come Jesus ye faithful. 
Tonight we eat...guacamole by the El 
Rio!

<character>CALCULON</character>
That was so terrible I think you gave 
me cancer! I don't care how popular 
you are, you will never work on my show!

<character>CALCULON</character>
However, you've got the job. Welcome 
aboard son!

<character>BENDER</character>
Fathero!

<info>He hugs Calculon.</info>

<info>All My Circuits Soundstage. Outside a red light is on and a 
sign indicates Taping In Progress, All Welcome (Writers Keep 
Out). On a hospital room set Calculon and Bender prepare for 
a scene.</info>

<character>CALCULON</character>
Bender I'd like you to meet our director......who's 
name I never learned.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yo! I read the script and I think it 
would help my character's motivation 
if he was on fire.

<character>DIRECTOR</character>
Uh, don't worry 'bout the script baby, 
we re-wrote your part to better suit 
your acting abilities.

<character>BENDER</character>
So now my character has a British accent?

<character>DIRECTOR</character>
No, now your character's in a coma. 
Get in bed and don't move.  And...action!

<character>BENDER</character>
(muttering) Stupid dumb coma...coulda 
been British.

<info>Calculon moves to his bedside.</info>

<character>CALCULON</character>
Alas that mine only son should sink 
into an irreversible, permanent...coma.

<character>BENDER</character>
(quietly) Permanent? That's completely 
out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' 
up.

<character>CALCULON</character>
Curse the tragic wildebeast accident 
that -

<info>Bender sits up on the bed.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey everyone! Antonio here but you can 
call me "Bender"! I got ants in my butt 
and I needs to strut.  C'mon baby!  
C'mon!

<info>The director stands watching, gobsmacked while a woman behind 
him leafs through the script. Calculon stares at Bender.</info>

<character>CALCULON</character>
I'm not familiar with the type of thing 
I'm seeing.

<character>BENDER</character>
Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooo yeah! 
C'mon baby, do that, oo yeah!

<character>DIRECTOR</character>
(shouting) Cut!  That's the worst coma 
acting I've ever seen. I'll have to 
shoot it again.

<character>CALCULON</character>
No! No, no, no I don't do two takes.

<character>DIRECTOR</character>
But this guy was -

<character>CALCULON</character>
Amateurs like you do two takes, I do 
one take. Print it, I'll be in my three 
storey trailer.

<info>He takes a bouquet of flowers from a woman.</info>

<info>All My Circuits Editting Room. Calculon and the director watch 
Bender's antics.</info>

<character>BENDER </character><info>ON TV</info>
Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooo yeah! 
C'mon baby, c'mon yeah!

<character>BENDER</character>
Now that's hospital dancing.  Pretty 
good eh Calcky?

<character>CALCULON</character>
Good? I've seen better acting from extras 
in Godzilla movies.  I don't even remember 
shooting this scene.

<character>DIRECTOR</character>
We didn't. That's security camera footage 
from your dressing room.

<character>CALCULON</character>
He stole the scene and my money? That's 
it! I demand you fire this felonious 
ham!

<info>An alarm beeps and a red light starts to flash.</info>

<character>DIRECTOR</character>
The network Execubots are coming!

<character>CALCULON</character>
Dear God!

<info>Enter three huge clunky robots on tracks.</info>

<character>BETABOT</character>
Presenting the president of the network.

<info>A man walks in, places a iBook on a desk and leaves. A modem 
in the iBook beeps and the network president, the iBook itself, 
starts to speak.</info>

<character>NETWORK PRESIDENT</character>
Greetings gentlemen, you already know 
my Execubots. Executive Alpha, programmed 
to like things that are seen before.

<character>ALPHABOT</character>
Hey hey hey.

<character>NETWORK PRESIDENT</character>
Executive Beta, programmed to roll dice 
to determine the fall schedule.

<info>Betabot rolls two dice.</info>

<character>BETABOT</character>
More reality shows.

<character>NETWORK PRESIDENT</character>
And Executive Gamma, programmed to underestimate 
middle America.

<character>GAMMABOT</character>
It's funny but is it going to get them 
off their tractors?

<info>The president plays a clip of Bender dancing on his screen.</info>

<character>NETWORK PRESIDENT</character>
Now, who put this obnoxious dancing 
robot on my network?

<character>DIRECTOR</character>
We were about to fire him sir.

<info>The president's screen has changed to a picture of a family 
in front of a TV screen.</info>

<character>NETWORK PRESIDENT</character>
Silence hack! We've been monitoring 
our Nielsen families carefully and during 
the 12 seconds Bender was on screen, 
viewer eyeball focus was up 90%.

<character>CALCULON</character>
Sir, children watch this show. Bender's 
no role model, he's a filth monger!

<character>NETWORK PRESIDENT</character>
At our network, we love filth! Filthy 
rich that is! Being filthy rich that 
is!  "Bite my shiny metal ass" could 
be a catchphrase.

<character>ALPHABOT</character>
80% likely.

<character>GAMMABOT</character>
It will play in Peoria.

<info>Betabot rolls his dice.</info>

<character>BETABOT</character>
Gameshows are back.

<character>NETWORK PRESIDENT</character>
We need this edgy, sweeps-ready robot 
on our network. Bender? Can you continue 
to drink, smoke and steal things on 
TV?

<info>Bender takes Calculon's wallet.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Yes I can.

<info>Musical To Black Flag's TV Party Bender's status as a cult icon 
rockets. On the side of the All My Circuits soundstage, men paste 
a huge picture of Bender over the cast picture. An episode of 
the show is broadcast where Human Friend is getting married, 
only for his bride to turn out to be Bender in the middle of 
the ceremony. He lifts his veil, lights a cigar and pulls out 
a copy of Playbot. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny Tim watch in the 
Planet Express lounge and cheer. At the 7^11 fine Bender tobacco 
products include Bender Smokes, Benderillos and Bender's Favorite. 
A kid points at the Bender's Favorite. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny 
Tim carry on watching All My Circuits. Bender is creditted as 
Starring Bender as "Bender." He walks into a restaurant where 
Calculon and Monique are dining and tips there table over along 
with the two of them. He drinks back a bottle of beer and randomly 
fires a laser into the air. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny Tim cheer 
and tip the table in the lounge over. The cover story on TV Week 
Monthly is Bender: TV's Rowdiest Robot Opens Up About Drinking, 
Smoking &amp; His Feud with Jay. Inside his chest cabinet is beer, 
cigars and Jay Leno's gagged head in a jar. In another episode 
Bender spits his cigar at Human Friend. It bounces off him and 
back into Bender's mouth.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny Tim laugh at 
Bender's antics. Dwight pulls out a pack of cigars perhaps.</info>

<character>DWIGHT</character>
Yo, check out what I jacked from my 
Dad.

<character>CUBERT</character>
A cigar!

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
Ripping!

<info>Dwight lights the cigar, takes a puff and impersonates his hero.</info>

<character>DWIGHT</character>
Look! I'm Bender!

<info>He suddenly vomits and faints. Enter Farnsworth and Hermes.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Ras H. Tafari. What's goin' on here?

<info>Farnsworth picks up the cigar in his feet and hands it to Hermes.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.

<character>HERMES</character>
That's not a cigar. Uh...and it's not 
mine!

<info>He puts it in his inside pocket.</info>

<character>CUBERT</character>
Hey Dad, bite my shiny metal ass!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable 
for both of us! Where did you learn 
such language?

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
From Bender my good jerkwad.

<character>HERMES</character>
Bender eh? That guy's really startin' 
to twist my dreads.

<info>Time Lapse. Farnsworth and Hermes are gone, replaced by Fry, 
Leela, Zoidberg and Bender on the couch. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny 
Tim sit on the floor all watching <character>TV</character>.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
OK OK OK, get ready for this part.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Quiet robot, Bender's on <character>TV</character>.

<info>On the TV Calculon and Monique enter a cabin covered in snow.</info>

<character>MONIQUE </character><info>ON TV</info>
Oh Calculon, it's so good to get away 
from the city and that beastly, yet 
intriguing, Bender.

<info>She gasps. Bender is guzzling down a kegg of beer on the other 
side of the room. He cheers and lights his finger like a lighter.</info>

<character>BENDER </character><info>ON TV</info>
Try this kids at home!

<info>A "Don't Try This Kids At Home" caption appears underneath. 
Bender lights his alcoholic breath and his head catches fire, 
followed by the rest of his body. The screen pulls back. The 
All My Circuits episode was just another clip on Entertainment 
And Earth Invasion Tonite.</info>

<character>LINDA </character><info>ON TV</info>
Is television sensation Bender a bad 
role model for Earth children?

<info>Bender spins a pair of scissors around on both of his hands. 
Zoidberg leans away from him.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
That's crazy.

<character>LINDA </character><info>ON TV</info>
A new protest group, Fathers Against 
Rude Television, says "Hell yes!"

<character>FRY</character>
Pft. What kind of bozos would start 
a Bender protest group?

<info>Enter Farnsworth and Hermes.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Good news everyone. Hermes and I have 
started a Bender protest group.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
That was uncanny.

<character>HERMES</character>
Fathers Against Rude Television don't 
want our kids watching Bender's high 
definition filth.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? 
That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.

<character>HERMES</character>
No sir, not us FARTers.

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't censor me 
just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role 
model.

<character>LEELA</character>
As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree 
with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten 
just from watching <character>TV</character>.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah. Give a little credit to our public 
schools.

<info>Planet Express: Attic Balcony. Dwight, Cubert and Tinny Tim 
sit slumped against the attic dome under the moonlight. Cubert 
sighs.</info>

<character>CUBERT</character>
Our dads are all pumped up on dorkosterum. 
We're just trying to be cool like Bender.

<character>DWIGHT</character>
Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking 
and drinking make us barf.

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
Gentle jerkwads. I know how to emulate 
Bender without barfing. We could commit 
a burglary.

<character>DWIGHT</character>
Hey, yeah!

<character>CUBERT</character>
Bender loves to burgle!

<character>DWIGHT</character>
Hold up though. Who could we rob? We 
don't even know anyone with cool stuff.

<character>CUBERT</character>
Duh! We know someone who runs on pure 
cool fuel. Bender!

<character>DWIGHT</character>
Whoa!

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
We'll rob Bender!

<info>Cubert laughs.</info>

<character>DWIGHT</character>
TV gave us the idea.

<info>Robot Arms Apartments Corridor. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny Tim 
sneak towards Fry and Bender's apartment with a sack.</info>

<character>CUBERT</character>
<character>OK</character>. It's crime time.

<info>He, Dwight and Tinny Tim put on some crude Bender face masks. 
Cubert opens the apartment door and they sneak in.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry and Bender's Lounge. Fry plays a console game with 
one hand while reading a Space Boy comic. He takes a swig of 
beer. Tinny Tim, wearing his Bender mask, walks past Fry carrying 
Bender's chair. Fry doesn't look up.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hey Bender.  Hey Bender.  Hey Bender. 
Hey Bender.

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. Cubert and Dwight's new party gets started. 
They open the door and Tinny Tim, some Cookieville orphans and 
Brett Blob walk in. Dwight and Cubert choose classical music 
for the party and play Bust A Move by Young <character>MC</character>.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. The room is filled with 
more kids. Brett plays Bender's banjo then hits one of his gold 
bricks with it, breaking the banjo. He and some others laugh. 
Albert smokes one of Bender's Zuban cigars and throws up. Tinny 
Tim takes a copy of Playbot out of a box marked "Bender's Adult 
Periodicals." He sees a spread inside and his eye litterally 
pop out. Enter Hermes and Farnsworth. The music stops.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
What's going on in here?  Oh. Now I'm 
really outraged.

<character>HERMES</character>
Where did you requisition this party? 
And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
I'm networking. Let me give you my card.

<info>He pulls out a scrap of card with "ZoiDBERg" written on it and 
offers it to Sally and Nina. Neither of them bother taking it.</info>

<character>CUBERT</character>
Relax Dad, we just invited a few friends 
over.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Hmm. There's something wrong with your 
story but I can't put my finger on it. 
Of course! You don't have friends!

<character>HERMES</character>
Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider 
you cool all of a sudden?

<character>DWIGHT</character>
Uh...we're just cool is all!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's 
cool, using the cool-o-meter!

<info>He takes a box with a needle on it out of his pocket. He scans 
over the orphans and the box beeps and the needle moves halfway 
around the gauge; he scans Zoidberg, who waves, and the beeping 
stops and the needle flops back down again; he scans more orphans 
and the needle goes back halfway. Finally he scans Tinny Tim, 
Dwight and Cubert and the machine beeps rapidly and the needle 
goes right around to maximum. A huge thumbs up pops out the side 
of the machine.</info>

<character>COOL</character>-O-<character>METER</character>
Oh yeah!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Good Lord, I'm getting a reading of 
over 40 mega-Fonzies!

<character>HERMES</character>
Everybody out!

<info>The kids groans and file out along with Zoidberg.</info>

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
So do you guys know about anything else 
going on, because I'm totally still 
ready to party.

<info>Hermes taps a girl on the shoulder and makes her hand something 
over. She hands him a lava lamp and runs out.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
There's enough cool stuff here to furnish 
a happenin' pad. Where did it all come 
from?

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
Don't tell comrades. All for one and 
one for all!

<info>Dwight and Cubert look at each other and cave.</info>

<character>DWIGHT</character>
We stole it!

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
Oh crumb!

<info>Bender's loot safe opens and Bender himself steps out of it 
and yawns and stretches.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
What? What's going on?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken 
up stealing! One of the worst and coolest 
of crimes.

<character>HERMES</character>
And all from watching you on TV you 
cool jerk.

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey lay off me. TV would stink if everyone 
on it was a positive role model. Bender 
is about entertainment baby! You can't 
hold me responsible for what kids do 
when - hey! This is my stuff they stole! 
That's the last straw! Bender should 
not be allowed on television!

<info>Outside Planet Express. At the back of the building hundreds 
of angry dads are crowded around to hear Bender make a speech. 
The back of the hangar has been opened so the ship is right behind 
him. Bender stands at a podium with Farnsworth and Hermes right 
beside him.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Bender must be stopped. I've gone too 
far. Who does that guy think I am?  
C'mon! We're gonna march all the way 
to Hollywood and make them stop forcing 
their filthy me down our throats.

<info>He turns around and heads towards the ship.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. Bender marches up the ship's 
steps followed by Hermes, Farnsworth and the other members of 
<character>FART</character>.</info>

<info>The ship takes off from the hangar, flies up into space and 
back down the other side of North America to Hollywood.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Television Studios. The <character>FART</character> mob march out of 
the ship chanting.</info>

<character>FART MOB</character>
(chanting) Down with Bender! Down with 
Bender! Down with Bender! Down with 
Bender!

<info>The stop marching when they reach a security barrier. Bender 
takes care of it.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
This mob's with me.

<character>SECURITY GUARD</character>
Go ahead.

<info>He raises the barrier and the mob carries on marching.</info>

<character>FART MOB</character>
(chanting) Down with Bender! Down with 
Bender! Down with Bender! Down with 
-  - Bender! Down with Bender!

<info>Cut to: All My Circuits Soundstage. On a hospital set Calculon 
is dressed as a doctor. Boxy is wearing a tuxedo and is in bed 
and a formally-dressed Fembot that looks like Boxy is in another 
bed.</info>

<character>CALCULON</character>
As a doctor and captain of this hospital 
shift, I now pronounce you man and wife 
with six months to live.

<info>His eyes widen in shock. Enter the <character>FART</character> mob.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Listen up Hollywood. We're an exciting 
new mob.

<info>The mob agree.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah!

<character>HERMES</character>
You'd better believe it!

<info>Calculon looks shocked.</info>

<character>CALCULON</character>
Great Shatner's ghost!

<character>BENDER</character>
We demand that all TVs be equipped with 
a v-chip that blocks Bender from appearing 
on the screen.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Booya!

<info>Enter the network president and his Execubots.</info>

<character>NETWORK PRESIDENT</character>
I'm afraid the answer is a gritty in-your-face 
no.

<character>BENDER</character>
Then I quit.

<character>NETWORK PRESIDENT</character>
Then you don't quit.  I think you'll 
be finishing the scene now Mr Bender 
and don't skimp on the nasty.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
There'll be no further nasty.  We still 
have the option of resorting to violence.

<character>HERMES</character>
What makes you think that'll work?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I saw it on TV in that episode where 
Bender shot Calculon! How cool is that?

<info>Bender dances around smoking a cigar.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Ooo yeah baby c'mon -

<info>He panics as Farnsworth points his laser at him.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Quit the show!

<character>NETWORK PRESIDENT</character>
Do the scene.

<info>Bender puts his hands up.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I'm a cold blooded punk!

<character>NETWORK PRESIDENT</character>
I once put a laugh track on a sitcom 
that had no jokes in it.

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey look, the prop guy has a lamp!

<info>The Execubot turns around with the president in his hands.</info>

<character>NETWORK PRESIDENT</character>
Really?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Wha?

<info>Bender yoinks the guns from their hands.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Aha!

<info>Farnsworth gasps.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I was using that!

<character>BENDER</character>
Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic 
speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera 
rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation.

<character>DIRECTOR</character>
You're angry.

<character>BENDER</character>
Perfect.  Viewers of the world, do smoking 
and drinking on TV really make me cool? 
Of course they do.  How 'bout committing 
crimes and violence? Again, the answer 
is "yes." But do we really want our 
kids exposed to that kind of trash on 
TV? I say absolutely not!  Uh...on the 
other hand, most - perhaps all the blame 
rests with the parents. That's right 
you!  And so I ask you this one question: 
Have you ever tried simply turning off 
the TV, sitting down with your children, 
and hitting them?

<character>HERMES</character>
(ashamed) We're just so busy.

<character>BENDER</character>
Well make time.

<character>DIRECTOR</character>
And...cut!

<info>Calculon applauds.</info>

<character>CALCULON</character>
Good enough. Splice in some reaction 
shots of me and shove it on the air.

<info>Planet Express: Lounge.</info>

<character>BENDER </character><info>ON TV</info>
...Have you ever tried simply turning 
off the TV, sitting down with your children, 
and hitting them?

<info>Archive All My Circuits footage of Calculon reacting to something 
completely different is spliced in. The whole crew, Cubert, Dwight 
and Tinny Tim watch the <character>TV</character>.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable 
lesson about TV there.

<character>CUBERT</character>
What was it?

<info>As Hermes defends himself on the TV there is more archive footage 
of Calculon reacting to something in a poker game.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Uh...that we should all take TV a little 
less seriously. And more importantly, 
turn it off once in a while.

<character>FRY</character>
Hear hear!

<character>LEELA</character>
Yeah!

<character>BENDER</character>
Damn right!

<info>On the TV Calculon reacts to something on a snowy mountain.</info>

<character>DWIGHT</character>
So, should we turn it off now?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Well, uh, that depends what's on.

<info>Fry flicks through the channels with the remote.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Nothing good.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Ah let's just keep watching.

<info>They all turn back to the screen and watch Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad.</info>

<info>Closing Credits. The crew perform Black Flag's TV Party while 
watching Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) TV party tonight!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Wha?

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) TV party tonight!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh!

<character>FRY</character>
(singing) We've got nothing better to 
do...

<character>LEELA</character>
(singing) ...Than watch TV and have 
a couple of brews!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(singing) Don't wanna talk about anything 
else...

<character>FRY</character>
(singing) We don't wanna know!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(singing) We're dedicated, yes!

<character>HERMES</character>
(singing) ...To our favourite shows!
