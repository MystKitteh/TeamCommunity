[Opening Credits. Caption: Now With Chucklelin.]

[Planet Express: Lounge. Fry and Bender sit on the couch while 
Leela perches on the end of it. Fry tears open a pack of Styro-Pak 
Cookies.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious 
but they produce an awful lot of trash.

[Fry takes out a small pack marked "Top," opens it, takes something 
out and puts it in a weird looking machine. He throws the packet 
on a pile of other packets. He rips open a pack marked "Bottom" 
and puts it in the other side of the machine. He rips open a 
pack marked "Middle," puts it in the middle of the machine and 
pulls a lever on the machine. The machine compresses the cookie 
sections and makes a cream filled cookie. He pulls it apart a 
licks out the cream from the middle. Bender sprays his antenna 
with something and slicks it back.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ah!

<character>LEELA</character>
And Bender, that aerosol head spray 
makes your head smell nice...

<character>BENDER</character>
Thank you.

<character>LEELA</character>
...but it's doing long-term damage to 
the planet.

<character>BENDER</character>
So? It's not like it's the only one 
we've got!

[Enter Farnsworth.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Good news everyone! I'm sending you 
on an extremely controversial mission!

<character>FRY</character>
Controversial?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh my no.

[Planet Express: Meeting Room. The lights are dimmed and there 
is a hologram in the middle of the table of the Planet Express 
ship docking with a tanker.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
For this highly controversial mission, 
you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an 
orbitting supertanker full of rich Columbian 
dark matter.

<character>LEELA</character>
Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? 
The tanker could leak!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Impossible!  The tanker has 6000 hulls. 
So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof! 
Now, once you've hauled the tanker 
past the protestors -

<character>LEELA</character>
Protestors?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Correct. 6000 hulls.

<character>LEELA</character>
Why do we have to fly within three feet 
of this penguin preserve on Pluto?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(whispering) To avoid the tollbooth.

[Planet Express: Hangar. Leela is wearing her green jacket and 
Farnsworth points at something on the ship to Bender. Fry walks 
down the steps with an empty trolley.]

<character>FRY</character>
Alright, she's all restocked with emergency 
jam. Let's get going.

<character>LEELA</character>
At the risk of sounding negative: No! 
Look Professor, I can't participate 
in this mission.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
What are you yapping about?

<character>LEELA</character>
This time it's your reckless disregard 
for the environment. In fact, I'm gonna 
go join those protestors.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
This is an outrage. I demand that you 
hand over your captain's jacket.

<character>LEELA</character>
This is my normal jacket. I've had it 
for 10 years.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I said hand it over!  Well Fry, or should 
I say Captain Fry?  No I shouldn't. 
Because Bender is the new captain!

<character>FRY</character>
Bender?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
That's right. Being a captain is about 
intuition and heart. A good captain 
can't have either one. That's why cold, 
logical Bender is perfect for the job.

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, I do think of human life as expendable.

[Ship's Cockpit. Bender sits in the pilot's seat and Zoidberg 
mans a console.]

<character>FRY</character>
No fair. Leela was training me to be 
captain. She even let me sit in her 
lap and steer - in this comic I drew.

[He pulls out a piece of paper. Zoidberg turns around.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Ooo, the new one's out!

[He takes it.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Fry, the title of captain may inflate 
the human ego, but it's beneath the 
notice of my mighty robo-logic!  Now 
look spry men! We launch at six bells!

[He takes a bell out of his chest cabinet and rings it six times.]

[A convoy of protestors in ship's fly towards the Juan Valdez 
which is orbitting Earth. They tow banners such as "Save The 
Crested Spinepecker" and "Think Intergalactically, Act Interplanetarily." 
A Green Party ship full of Kif's people fly by and a larger ship 
belonging to Penguins Unlimited flies by.]

[Cut to: Penguins Unlimited Ship. A huge crowd of protestors 
are gathered on the deck. Preparing for a speech is Free Waterfall 
Sr, father of Free Waterfall Jr who led the campaign against 
eating Popplers in The Problem With Popplers.]

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Greetings Econauts. I'm Free Waterfall 
Sr, founder of Penguins Unlimited.  
Whoa! No, no! No applause. Every time 
you clap your hands you kill thousands 
of spores that'll some day form a nutritious 
fungus. Just show your approval with 
a mould-friendly thumbs up!  Please 
hold your thumbs until the end. Now 
folks, its time to stop that tanker 
with a non-violent human circle.

[Leela stands up.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Why do we have to resort to non-violence? 
Can't we just kick their asses?

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Now little lady, those people's asses 
are living things too!

[The Planet Express ship beeps as it back up and docks with the 
Juan Valdez, using a tow bar.]

[Cut to: Ship's Cockpit.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Aye! We're hitched up tighter than Davy 
Jones' U-Haul! At ease men!

[Fry swats a fly on his arm while lying back with his feet up.]

<character>FRY</character>
I am at ease.

<character>BENDER</character>
Mr Fry. I like to give my first mate 
an informal nickname. From now on, you 
will be known as...Wiggles!

[He wiggles his fingers.]

<character>WIGGLES</character>
The hell I will! Have you even read 
the captain's handbook?

[He holds up the Captain's Handbook - Now With Pop-up Sextant. 
Bender takes it and flips through it quickly.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I have now. And what's Peter Parrot's 
first rule of captaining?

<character>WIGGLES</character>
Always respect the chain-o-command - 
captain.

<character>BENDER</character>
Correct Wiggles. You've just earned 
an invitation to the captain's table.

[He leaves and Zoidberg leans over the back of his chair.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(whispering) The captain's table! What 
an honour!

[Peace Ring. Hundreds of protestors have surrounded the tanker 
in a human circle.]

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Our peace ring has 'em trapped like 
a tiger in a washing machine!

[The Planet Express ship's engine starts to flare up.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Get ready!

<character>PROTESTOR #1</character>
Look out!

<character>PROTESTOR #2</character>
Hold on!

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Here they come.

[The ship rises up from the middle of the peace ring and tows 
the tanker over the top of the protestors. It flies away.]

<character>LEELA</character>
When you were planning this peace ring, 
didn't you realise spaceships can move 
in three dimensions?

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
No I did not.

[The protestors' ships fly into Pluto space and pass a sign saying 
Pluto - Last Restroom Before Proxima Centauri.]

[Outside Penguins Unlimited <character>HQ</character>. The protestors walk towards the 
building on the icy Pluto surface.]

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Folks, that tanker gave us the slip 
but we'll stop 'em here on Pluto! If 
you're cold, rub your bodies with permafrost. 
It's nature's long johns.  If rubbing 
frozen dirt in your crotch is wrong, 
hey I don't wanna be right!

[Penguins Unlimited <character>HQ</character>. Enter the protestors. The building is 
a huge glass dome. In the middle of the room are holes in the 
ground with bars around them. Waterfall shows Leela what is inside.]

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
This here is our penguin preserve.

[In the holes baby penguins cheep.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Aww they're so cute! They're like if 
puppies and kittens could have babies!

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
We use hand puppets around young uns 
to simulate a natural environment.

[In the hole a man's arm with a penguin puppet over his hand 
appears from under the floor. The beak opens and the man feeds 
the baby penguins little fish. They grab his hand and start biting 
it and one steals his watch. He screams.]

<character>LEELA</character>
That's adorable.

[The man screams louder.]

[The Planet Express ship flies past Saturn with the tanker still 
in tow.]

[Cut to: Ship's Rec Room. Bender has converted it to a captain's 
private dining room and uses the table tennis table to eat off. 
He and Fry are in the middle of a pasta meal and he is in the 
middle of a speech.]

<character>BENDER</character>
...But I suppose it's this medal I'm 
most proud of Wiggles. I won it for 
saving the children of Earth from a 
giant kangaroo. It was on the Australian 
news, you probably didn't see it.

[Zoidberg, sitting at the other end of the table across the net, 
claps.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Brilliant!

<character>FRY</character>
Would you cram a sock in it Bender? 
Those aren't even medals! They're bottlecaps 
and pepperoni slices.

[Bender rings a bell and Zoidberg refills his glass.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Thank you steward. Wiggles? Weren't 
you about to propose a toast to your 
gallant captain?

<character>FRY</character>
Fine, I've got a toast. To Captain Bender! 
He's the best......at being a big jerk 
and his big ugly face is as dumb as 
a butt.

<character>BENDER</character>
Eh, I've heard better.

<character>FRY</character>
If I were in charge I wouldn't treat 
you like this. You're nothing but a 
big blowhard.

[He knocks Bender's bell off the table. Bender stands up.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Sir, you forget yourself! Shut up!

[He knocks Fry's plate off the table it hits the wall and slides 
down to the floor. Zoidberg looks at it and dives to the floor 
and starts eating what's left of Fry's food.]

<character>FRY</character>
Being captain is obviously more important 
to you than being my friend. I'm going.

<character>BENDER</character>
Going? But, a captain can't drink without 
his first mate!

[Fry leaves. Zoidberg peeps over the edge of the table.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
You can drink with me maybe?

<character>BENDER</character>
I don't feel like drinking.

[He takes off his hat and starts to walk out.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Then if you'll excuse me I see some 
ravioli that only has two shoeprints 
on it.  Three.

[The ship and tanker flies past Neptune, Urectum and Charon and 
heads for Pluto.]

[Cut to: Ship's Cockpit. Bender is sober and his face is covered 
in five o'clock rust. He lies back in the pilot's seat and looks 
like he is about to slide of as he wildly steers the ship singing 
an olde sea shanty.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(soberly singing) Oh Greenland is a 
barren land, a land that bears no green. 
Where there's ice and snow and the whale 
fishies blow and the -

[Enter Zoidberg with a bottle of Olde Fortran Liquor.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Captain please, have some liquor. You 
robots need alcohol to function.

<character>BENDER</character>
Gah! I once knew a guy...you look like 
him. But he wasn't either.  I'm a good 
captain.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Please sir, I love you like a father!

[Bender grabs the wheel and steers the ship sharply starboard, 
knocking Zoidberg off balance. He screams as he falls.]

[Pluto Surface. The protestors hold up signs such as "Give A 
Hooto Don't Pollute Pluto!", "Preserve Our Useless Wasteland" 
and "Free Chilly Willy."]

<character>PROTESTOR #3</character>
Here they come, oh I hope they read 
my sign!

[He holds up the sign that reads "Go Away Tanker!" The ship and 
tanker fly over the planet surface upside-down.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender's flying too low! And he's upside-down!

<character>PROTESTOR #3</character>
He must be talking on a cell phone!

[The tanker hits an iceberg and it scrapes a huge hole along 
the hull releasing a torrent of dark matter oil.]

[Cut to: Ship's Cockpit. The room is flooded with red light and 
the message "Danger" repeatedly flashes on the screens. Bender 
snores loudly. Enter Fry and Zoidberg.]

<character>FRY</character>
What's happening?

[Zoidberg turns on another screen that displays the extent of 
the damage to the tanker. There is a huge gash most of the way 
along it's hull. A gauge at one side of the screen drops as the 
dark matter levels go down.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
All 6000 hulls have been breached!

[Fry falls to his knees.]

<character>FRY</character>
Oh the fools! If only they'd built it 
with 6001 hulls! When will they learn?

[Cut to: Pluto Surface. The leaking tanker speeds towards the 
screaming protestors and a tidal wave of dark matter oil washes 
towards them. Leela sighs and zips up her coat around her head. 
Her eye stares through her coat hood as the wave engulfs her 
and the others.]

[Prison Cell. On the TV in the corner Morbo and Linda present 
a news report under the headline "Tanked!"]

<character>LINDA </character>[ON TV]
Continuing our coverage of a tragic 
- but far away - story. The crisis on 
Pluto worsens as dark matter spreads 
throughout the penguin habitat. The 
images are truly horrific.

[The picture changes to oil-covered penguins. One coughs and 
two others slip on the oil with crazy sound effects added. The 
caption on the screen reads "Sound Effects Added To Lessen Tragedy." 
Another penguin repeatedly slips over with boingy sounds to go 
with it. Leela is interviewed.]

<character>LEELA </character>[ON TV]
I don't think any of those poor, oil-drenched 
penguins feel.

[She slips over with added sound effects. The scene returns to 
the studio and Morbo laughs.]

<character>MORBO </character>[ON TV]
Oily humanoid!  At the time of the crash, 
the tanker captain had an alcohol level 
of .08 percent - well below the legal 
limit for robots.

[A picture of Bender appears in the corner of the screen in a 
pose remiscent of Captain Joseph Hazelwood of the Exxon Valdez, 
with his arms up trying to hide his face from the cameras. Bender 
sighs and turns away from the TV and holds the cell bars. The 
Hyper-Chicken lawyer paces around on the other side.]

<character>HYPER</character>-<character>CHICKEN</character>
Son, as your lawyer I declare y'all 
are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. 
But I done struck you a deal; Five hours 
of community service cleanin' up that 
ole mess you caused.

<character>BENDER</character>
Five hours? Aw man! Couldn't you have 
just gotten me the death penalty?

<character>HYPER</character>-<character>CHICKEN</character>
I'd have done better but it's plum hard 
pleadin' a case while awaitin' trial 
for that there incompetance!

[He grabs hold of the bars. It is he who is in prison rather 
than Bender.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah, uh, good luck with that.

[He walks out.]

[Pluto Surface. Bender scrubs the penguins while Smitty and <character>URL </character>
watch him.]

[Cut to: Penguins Unlimited Shelter. The activists clean the 
oil from the penguins. One baths them, Free Waterfall Sr rubs 
them dry with a towel and Leela blow dries them. She puts one 
down on the ground, licks her finger and rubs it's cheek like 
a mother.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Now you stay away from those puffin 
twins.

[She sends it on it's way. Waterfall gives some more survival 
tips to people.]

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Good way to avoid frostbite folks: Put 
your hands between your buttocks.  That's 
nature's pocket.

<character>LEELA</character>
Uh...I think I'll go check on Bender.

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Watch that he doesn't pick your pocket.

[Cut to: Pluto Surface. Bender holds a penguin over his head 
and wrings the oil into his mouth.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ah, can't beat fresh squeezed!

[Enter Leela.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, can you at least pretend you're 
being punished?  And clean the black 
parts too.

[She walks off. Bender mocks her. Smitty and <character>URL</character> look at some 
penguins.]

<character>SMITTY</character>
Are they black with white feathers or 
white with black feathers?

<character>URL</character>
It don't matter baby, they're all beautiful!

[They hug.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Yo, screws, more Tegrin over here?  
Oh ho, what's this?

[He ducks behind an ice rock, pulls a tuxedo out of his chest 
cabinet and puts it on. He lowers his legs to penguin height 
and wanders over to the flock of penguins and cackles evily. 
Smitty and <character>URL</character> stop hugging and look around. Bender is gone.]

<character>URL</character>
Aww man, he got away!

<character>SMITTY</character>
I guess this is why chief says no hugging.

[Time Lapse. The Penguins Unlimited group heads for the Penguins 
Unlimited <character>HQ</character>.]

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Good work everyone. I suggest you all 
go get some sleep. Me, well I'm gonna 
stay up all night singing songs about 
penguins in a fine piercing tenor.

<character>LEELA</character>
Has anyone seen Bender? (shouting) Bender? 
Here robot robot robot.

[Penguins Unlimited HQ Rec Room. Fry and Zoidberg play on a games 
console. Enter Leela.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Hey, why weren't you Kong donkeys outside 
cleaning up?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
They sent us inside for doing an unsatisfactory 
job.  (sadly) And eating penguin eggs.

<character>FRY</character>
You ate most of them. So, where's Captain 
Bender? Off catastrophising some other 
planet?

[He chuckles. Zoidberg slaps him.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Dammit Fry! He may have done wrong, 
but he's still your captain.

<character>LEELA</character>
I'm worried about him. He didn't come 
back with the group.

<character>FRY</character>
He didn't?

<character>LEELA</character>
No. And with windchill it's 20 degrees 
below absolute zero. I'd better go find 
him.

[She pulls her hood over her head and starts to leave. Fry grabs 
her shoulder.]

<character>FRY</character>
Wait. Let me. Bender and I have our 
disagreements, but we're still friends 
and I'm gonna show him what that means. 
To the ship.

<character>LEELA</character>
Why don't you just walk? He was only 
about 20 yards from here.

<character>FRY</character>
Madam, I am in command now.

[He walks out and Zoidberg follows him.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Such a man. I'd follow him to hell and 
back I would.

[Outside Penguins Unlimited <character>HQ</character>. The ship takes off and reverses 
away from the building.]

[Pluto Surface. Night has fallen and the penguins and Bender 
are asleep. Bender snores. The penguins suddenly wake up and 
start walking. Bender, still asleep, walks with them. He wakes 
up and starts panicking.]

<character>BENDER</character>
What the?  What's this water made of? 
Ice? Forget this!

[He swims away but a killer whale grabs hold of him � la R2-D2 
in The Empire Strikes Back and starts throwing him around, diving 
in and out of the water. The whale spits him out and he lands 
head first on the land. A surge of electricity wraps around him 
and he whistles and falls over then blacks out.]

[Time Lapse. Bender starts to re-boot. His eyes open and his 
system starts scanning local lifeforms. The penguins. He resets 
to penguin mode and starts loading penguin language. Tasks: 1) 
Acquire Food. 2) Frolic. He stands up and looks around.]

<character>PENGUIN #1</character>
(in penguin) Full of fish?

<character>BENDER</character>
(in penguin) Not entirely.

<character>PENGUIN #1</character>
(in penguin) Then let's fish.

[The penguins and Bender head back towards the lake.]

[Ship's Cockpit. Fry flys the ship through space and Zoidberg 
look anxiously through the window.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Captain, I don't think we're on Pluto 
any longer. In fact, we may have left 
space as we know it.

<character>FRY</character>
Then where are we? You said you knew 
how to navigate.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(shouting) Stop yelling at me!

[He bursts into tears.]

[Pluto Surface. The flock of penguins chatter to each other. 
Bender looks sadly at a family of penguins. He looks away and 
sees a female penguin. He wanders over to her but a male penguin 
steps in his way and squawks at him. He sees another female penguin, 
walks towards her and kisses her perhaps. They both waddle off 
together.]

[Montage The penguins fish for fish. They slide down an ice bank 
and dive into the water. Bender slides down halfway but his antenna 
gets stuck in the ice and he stops, causing a pile-up of penguins 
behind him. Next he prepares to sit on some eggs to keep them 
warm but accidentally squashes them instead. He looks embarrassed 
and covers the yolk stain on him with his tux tails. In the water 
penguins catch one or two fish in their beaks and Bender uses 
his antenna to harpoon three at once. Back on land Bender stands 
up. There are two baby penguins underneath him. He sees another 
penguin regurgitate food for the little ones. He picks up a fish 
and throws it into his mouth which acts as a blender. At the 
end of the day Bender sits with the group of penguins and chatters.]

[Penguins Unlimited HQ Meeting Room. On a blackboard is a diagram 
of one penguin, followed by an arrow, followed by lots of penguins. 
Free Waterfall Sr stands at a podium in front of the board. Hippies 
are on seats around the room.]

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Folks it's worse than we thought. Seems 
dark matter is nature's sex drug. It's 
like a perverted trail mix of penguin 
estrogen, penguin Viagra and Spanish 
penguin fly. Why, it's making them ultra-fertile.

<character>LEELA</character>
How ultra?

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Well your garden variety penguin lays 
one egg a year. Since the spill our 
penguins have been laying six eggs every 
15 minutes.  Also the eggs hatch in 
only 12 hours.  Also the males are laying 
eggs.

[The hippies gasp again. A man faints and a doctor rushes to 
him.]

<character>DOCTOR</character>
This man is over-gasped.

[He and another hippy carry the man out.]

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
If the birds keep multiplying soon there'll 
be too many to count.  Before long they'll 
exhaust their food supply and starve 
to death.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh if only we hadn't flown penguins 
to Pluto and dumped oil on them, this 
might never have happened. Can't we 
stop them from multiplying?

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Yes I reckon it is our responsibility. 
And thankfully we have a plan.

<character>LEELA</character>
What is it? We'll do anything.

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Everyone grab your guns. I declare penguin 
hunting season officially open.

[He pulls out a gun and cocks it and so do the other hippies. 
Leela looks around in horror.]

[Outside Penguins Unlimited <character>HQ</character>. The penguins have multiplied 
so much that most of the once ice-covered landscape outside the 
building is now filled with a sea of penguins.]

[Cut to: Penguins Unlimited HQ Rec Room. The hippies clean out 
their guns while Leela protests the penguins' innocence.]

<character>LEELA</character>
You can't shoot penguins. Isn't there 
some way to prevent them from breeding?

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Cold showers don't work on Antarctic 
creatures. Now surely you agree that 
a quick semi-painless death is a darn 
sight better than weeks of starvation.

<character>LEELA</character>
Well...I suppose...but...I mean...I 
joined Penguins Unlimited to love penguins, 
not to hunt them.

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
This time the two are one and the same! 
Now are you with us or are you gonna 
let innocent penguins suffer?

[He pulls back a curtain. Outside the penguins are squashed up 
the window like those healthy people in the Star Trek episode 
Wink Of An Eye. Leela takes a step back.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(crying) Oh God it's inhuman! It's like 
Hong Kong! I'll do it!

[Outside Penguins Unlimited <character>HQ</character>. Leela is holding a gun.]

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
That's a good old fashioned gun. Simple 
point-and-click interface. Rifle check!

[The hunters cock their guns and laugh.]

<character>HUNTER #1</character>
Oh yeah!

<character>HUNTER #2</character>
Wee doggy!

<character>LEELA</character>
Hey, you're enjoying this.

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Look nobody enjoys shooting penguins. 
But if you have to shoot penguins, well 
you might as well enjoy it.

<character>LEELA</character>
I'm sorry but if it's fun in any way 
it's not environmentalism.

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Oh really? How 'bout blowing up dams?

<character>LEELA</character>
Yeah...that is fun.

[He cocks his gun.]

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Let's conservate!

[Outside Ship. The ship glides through space...with a giant space-squid 
holding onto it. Fry screams.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(shouting; from ship) It's been an honour 
to serve under you sir!

[Pluto Surface. Leela walks over the icy surface with her gun. 
She crawls to a ledge and sees a flock of penguins.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Alright, this is for their own good. 
Don't leave orphans. Gotta kill entire 
families.  But they're so cute. No! 
You can do this. It's just like murdering 
a little butler. I...I can't look.  
(crying) Oh no! What have I done?  Oh 
you poor little guy! I'm so sorry I 
- Bender?  What's going on? Were you 
hiding out with these little guys?

<character>BENDER</character>
Of course not. Filthy ice rats. Scat! 
Shoo!  Gah! What are you doing? Get 
away!

<character>LEELA</character>
Aww, they love you!

<character>BENDER</character>
Well I don't love them.  Aww!  I don't 
know why but when I look down at their 
little faces, it makes me wanna puke! 
In a good way!

[They hear some guns firing and turn around and see the hunters.]

<character>PENGUINS</character>
(in penguin) Stand still. It's our only 
hope.

<character>BENDER</character>
(in penguin) That's Puffin talk. Now 
follow me!

[He runs away and they follow. Leela turns to the hunters.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Stop! Stop shooting! It's me, Leela.

[A hunter shoots off a bit of her hood.]

<character>HUNTER #2</character>
Sorry.

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Why aren't you firing randomly into 
those birds little lady? Don't you wanna 
help 'em?

<character>LEELA</character>
Not this way.

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
What? Why you're not a tree-hugging 
kook at all!

<character>LEELA</character>
Look, I don't know if shooting penguins 
will help the environment or not. But 
I do know that the decision shouldn't 
be in the hands of people who just wanna 
kill for fun.

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Leela, you may just be farming some 
free-range truth there.  On the other 
hand we just made up 200 pounds of batter 
for penguin tempura. OK boys, it's them 
or us!

[They cock their guns.]

<character>LEELA</character>
No!

[They get ready to shoot but the penguins are gone.]

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
Hey where'd they - ?

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Attack!

[He and the penguins are standing on a ledge behind the hunters. 
They slide down the ledge head first towards the hunters. Leela 
dives out of the way and the penguins swarm at the hunters.]

<character>HUNTER #1</character>
Whoa!

<character>HUNTER #2</character>
Ow!

<character>BENDER</character>
(in penguin) We will fight them on the 
beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!

[Some penguins catch up with Waterfall and he falls over. They 
engulf him and start to eat him.]

<character>WATERFALL SR</character>
(shouting) Make sure they use every 
part of my body!

[Waterfall's father - a man with a silly hat, a big beard and 
braces - shakes his fist at the penguins.]

<character>OLD MAN WATERFALL</character>
(shouting) I'll avenge your death son!

[Leela and Bender watch the penguin feast.]

<character>LEELA</character>
They used to be such peaceful birds. 
I suppose this was your doing.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yep. It's like I taught 'em. If it ain't 
black and white - peck scratch and bite! 
Now to take off my tuxedo.  Guys, it's 
me! Your lovable dictator! Uh-oh!

[The penguins start to chase them. One pecks Bender's shiny metal 
ass. They come to the top of an ice hill and peer over the other 
side. It is very steep.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, if only we had a toboggan.

[She looks Bender up and down.]

[Time Lapse. They both slide down the mountain.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Faster! Faster!

[Leela - the toboggan - slides down the hillside faster. They 
slide onto a piece of ice jutting out into the water. Bender 
stomps across it and cracks it and it floats away from the land. 
The penguins watch them float away.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Phew!

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh phew!  Oh right they can swim. It's 
all coming back to me now.

[The penguins climb onto the ice block and Bender and Leela back 
away to the other side. The penguins surround them. The Planet 
Express ship flies overhead.]

<character>LEELA</character>
It's Fry!

<character>BENDER</character>
Wiggles?

[Fry lands the ship on the other side of the ice block. It's 
weight tips the ice back and the penguins slide down it. The 
whale appears on the other side and the penguins slide into it's 
mouth � la Orca.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, at least it'll help reduce their 
population.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah, life is hilariously cruel.  Permission 
to come aboard Wiggles?

[Fry pulls him up onto the lift.]

<character>FRY</character>
Granted. We can't take off without our 
captain.

[He takes off Bender's hat and gives it to him. Leela coughs. 
She is still hanging on to the edge of the ice block.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, and bring my toboggan.

[Ship's Cockpit. Fry flies the ship away from Pluto.]

<character>FRY</character>
So Leela, were you able to help the 
penguins?

<character>LEELA</character>
Well sure. I mean...not really...I mean...nature 
will work itself out. It can't screw 
things up any worse than we did trying 
to fix things right?

<character>FRY</character>
(mumbling) I 'unno.

<character>BENDER</character>
Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my 
shining influence those stupid birds'll 
do just fine.

[Cut to: Pluto Surface. The shadows of two penguins creep over 
two abandoned guns. They pick the guns up, point them at each 
other and cock them.]
