<title>A FLIGHT TO REMEMBER</title>

<transcriber>Dave, The Neutral Planet</transcriber>
</episodeInfo>
<info>The ship flies towards Earth, towards the Planet Express building. 
The landing gear comes down and the ship lands.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. The crew walk out. Their hair 
is ruffled, their clothes are torn and dirty.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
That was the worst delivery ever.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah. I'm never going to another planet 
called Cannibalon!

<character>BENDER</character>
Me neither. (upbeat) Food was good, 
though.

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Farnsworth is sat at the 
table, drinking from a cup. He turns around when the crew walk 
in.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh, great news, everyone.

<character>BENDER</character>
Shove it! We quit!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
In that case I'll have to hire a new 
crew to go on our company vacation.

<character>LEELA</character>
Vacation?

<character>BENDER</character>
Alright!

<info>He and Fry high five.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
This is great! I haven't had time off 
since I was 21 through 24.

<info>They sit down.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
It's just my way of thanking you for 
not reporting my countless violations 
of safety and minimum wage laws.

<character>BENDER</character>
Aww, you!

<info>He knocks Farnsworth affectionately on the shoulder.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I've booked us all on the maiden voyage 
of the largest, most luxurious space 
cruise ship ever built.  The Titanic!

<info>The Titanic is a futuristic space version of the <character>RMS</character> Titanic, 
with bubble domes and rocket engines. And rings, of course.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Looks nice.

<info>Ominous music. They carry on staring at the brochure ... unaware.</info>

<info>Opening Credits. Caption: Filmed On Location.</info>

<info>A huge spaceport sits high above the skyline of New New York. 
The rotating disc on top indicates it is South Street Spaceport.</info>

<info>Cut to: South Street Spaceport Departures. The whole crew emerges 
from the travel tubes in the departure area which looks similar 
to that of an airport.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, uh, where's my suitcase?  Ow!

<info>South Street Spaceport. The huge Titanic sits moored to the 
port and Mayor Poopenmeyer gives a speech.</info>

<character>POOPENMEYER</character>
As Mayor of New New York, it's my pleasure 
to introduce the honorary captain for 
the Titanic's maiden voyage. A man who 
single-handedly defeated the Retiree 
People of the Assisted Living Nebula: 
Zapp Brannigan!

<info>Zapp walks forward and waves to the crowd. They cheer and applaud.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, God! Not Zapp Brannigan!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
You know Zapp Brannigan?

<character>LEELA</character>
Let's just say we've "crossed paths".

<character>BENDER</character>
Was that before or after you slept with 
him?

<info>Zapp looks at the Titanic.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
She's a beautiful ship alright. Shapely, 
seductive. I'm gonna fly her brains 
out.  And now, without further adieu, 
I christen this ship, Titanic.

<info>Kif hands him Leonardo DiCaprio's head in a jar. Zapp smashes 
it against the side of the ship. DiCaprio's head bounces away. 
The crowd applauds and cheers.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Passengers are now boarding via old-style gangways. 
Zapp personally welcomes passengers. He sees the Planet Express 
crew and Leela walking up the gangway.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Well, well, well! The Lady Leela. Take 
notes, Kif. You're about to witness 
the subtle waltz known as seduction. 
So, trapped on a ship with me. What 
say you and I knock some very sensual 
boots?

<character>LEELA</character>
It's tempting, but, uh, I have a fianc� 
now. Uh, hmm, uh, hmm, uh, we--, uh 
...  Him! Fry, darling, meet Zapp Brannigan.

<character>FRY</character>
Huh?  Ooh! How do you do?

<info>He shakes Zapp's hand. Zapp narrows his eyes at Fry.</info>

<info>The Titanic leaves port honking its horn to the cheering crowds. 
It flies away from Earth and off into space.</info>

<info>Titanic First Class Corridor. The crew walk across polished 
floors and past a grand wooden staircase straight out of the 
film Titanic. They walk through another corridor.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Ah, here's my stateroom.

<info>He walks in, followed by everyone else. Bender suddenly sees 
something and stops and purrs. He zooms in on a well-dressed 
Fembot and she does the same. He zooms in further and his eyes 
fall out. He scrambles around the floor for them.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Come on, where is it?  Ohh!

<info>Titanic First Class State Room. Everyone, especially Fry, seems 
settled in in the room's plush furnishings.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Now, Hermes, you and your lovely wife 
LaBarbara have the suite through there. 
And Dr. Zoidberg, your marble tank is 
on the other side.

<info>Fry bounces on a green chair.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Man, first class seems nice!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
It'll seem even nicer once you've seen 
your room.

<info>He hands Amy a key.</info>

<info>Titanic First Class Deck. Amy, Leela, Bender and Fry stand waiting 
for the elevator.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Looks like we're on the Fiesta Deck.

<info>The elevator door opens.</info>

<info>Cut to: Titanic Elevator. Amy presses a button and the elevator 
goes down. Past second class where there are lots of t-shirt 
wearing tourists with fat children and cameras. Past steerage 
where there are lots of stereotypical Irish people. Past laundry 
which is already filled with clothes. Past the bowels of the 
ship where men shovel coal into furnaces. It stops at the Fiesta 
deck and the doors opens to a dank, dripping corridor.</info>

<info>Titanic Fiesta Deck Corridor. The crew emerge from the elevator.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
This is it.

<info>She opens the door and groans.</info>

<info>Cut to: Titanic Fiesta Deck Room. The room is dank room with 
leaky pipes and four camp beds along the side.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Well at least we get a window!

<info>He pulls a blind up and is blasted in the face with reactor 
fumes.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, I'm tired of this room and everyone 
in it. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna 
pop over to the casino for the next 
135 hours!

<info>He leaves.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
I think I'll go and fill up on bisque 
at the buffet.

<info>She closes the door as she leaves.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I guess that just leaves you and your 
fake fianc� ... all alone ... on a romatic 
cruise.

<info>He puts his arm around her.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Take it off or I'll break it off.

<character>FRY</character>
OK!

<info>He takes his arm from around her. Zapp opens the door.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Captain's inspection!

<info>Leela puts Fry's arm back around her and smiles weakly.</info>

<info>Titanic Casino. Bender already looks settled in, standing at 
a craps table.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hmm.  I'm bettin' it all!  Come on, 
baby needs a new pair of feet!

<info>He rolls the dice.</info>

<character>CROUPIER</character>
Snake eyes.

<info>He rakes in the chips.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
No! My cheating unit malfunctioned! 
You gotta give me a do-over!

<character>CROUPIER</character>
Sorry, the house limit is three do-overs. 
Next shooter.

<info>Bender takes a seat at the bar and sighs.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Gimmie you're biggest, strongest, cheapest 
drink.

<info>The bartender, iZac, turns around.</info>

<character>IZAC</character>
You got it!

<info>He fills a bucket. Bender turns around and sees the Fembot from 
earlier. He gasps and walks over to introduce himself.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Bender.

<character>COUNTESS</character>
Charmed. I'm the Countess de la Roca. 
I was surprised to see another robot 
staying in first class. Most of the 
robots I meet are labourers.

<character>BENDER</character>
I assure you, I barely know the meaning 
of the word "labour".

<info>The Countess laughs.</info>

<character>COUNTESS</character>
Oh, Mr. Bender!

<character>BENDER</character>
Please, call me Bender.

<info>He kisses her hand.</info>

<character>COUNTESS</character>
(embarrassed) Oh, goodness. I don't--

<info>As he kisses her, he reaches around and takes some money from 
her purse.</info>

<info>Titanic Wheel Room. Zapp stands in front of an old-fashioned 
sailing wheel. Kif emerges from a washroom.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Kif, I'm feeling the captain's itch.

<character>KIF</character>
I'll get the powder, sir.

<character>ZAPP</character>
No, the itch for adventure! Prepare 
to change course.

<character>KIF</character>
Sir, this is a leisure cruise. Our path 
was set by the travel agency.

<info>He presses a button and a map comes down on the wall showing 
the route is a straight line from Earth to another planet.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
That's for schoolgirls! Now here's a 
route with some chest hair.

<info>He squiggles a new course onto the map.</info>

<character>KIF</character>
But that course leads directly through 
a swarm of comets.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Yes, comets! The icebergs of the sky. 
By jackknifing from one to the next 
at breakneck speed we might just get 
some kind of gravity boost ... or something. 
It's time to shove a jalape�o up this 
ship's tailpipe.  Divert power from 
the shields, full speed ahead!

<info>Titanic Buffet. Amy is dishing up a bowlful of bisque.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Oh yeah--!

<info>She turns around and gasps and drops the bowl when she sees 
her parents.</info>

<character>MRS. WONG</character>
Amy! Hello!

<character>AMY</character>
Mom? Dad? What are you doing here?

MR <character>WONG</character>
We were planning on enjoying a relaxing 
vacation. But since you're here, we'll 
have to do some meddling.

<character>MRS WONG</character>
We met the nicest boy in the cabin next 
to ours.

MR <character>WONG</character>
He's not very ugly.

<character>MRS WONG</character>
You should marry him! Or at least use 
him to conceive a grandchild for us.

MR <character>WONG</character>
There he is at the buffet!

<info>He points at a large man leaning over the sneeze guard and dipping 
his finger in the bisque to taste it.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Uh, he seems really nice but, well, 
I already have a boyfriend.

<character>MRS WONG</character>
Really? Where is he?

MR <character>WONG</character>
And why isn't he here right now fathering 
our grandchild?

<character>AMY</character>
Uh ...

<info>Titanic Deck. Fry and Leela are outside, looking at the stars.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, our accommodations aren't great 
but it sure is beautiful our here.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, it's pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean 
platonic. Th-That sure is one platonic 
view!

<character>LEELA</character>
Fry, just be quiet. I'm beginning to 
think this whole fake fianc� thing was 
a terrible, terrible--

<info>She turns and gasps, then grabs Fry and kisses him.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hmm? Mmmm!

<character>ZAPP</character>
Leela, perhaps this is an awkward time 
but if things don't work out with this 
pipsqueak here ...  ... I just want 
you to know I'll be there to score you 
on the rebound.

<info>He walks away, humming. Leela stops kissing Fry.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Uh, look, before you get any crazy ideas, 
that was for Zapp.

<character>FRY</character>
Well, you got anything else for him?

<character>LEELA</character>
Alright, can we try not to complicate 
this?

<info>Enter Amy and her parents.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Mom, Dad. I'd like you to meet Fry, 
my boyfriend.

<info>She kisses him.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hmm? Mmmm!

<info>Time Lapse. Later, the crew relax in swimsuits by the swimming. 
Leela lies on a sunbed wearing a green swimsuit with a hole around 
the navel. Fry says goodbye to fake girlfriend #2.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
See you later, wuvvums!

<info>He kisses Amy and she leaves with her parents. He sits on a 
sunbed next to Leela.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
It would have been nice if you'd told 
me you were going out with Amy.

<character>FRY</character>
I'm not going out with Amy. It's just 
to fool her parents. Hey, you're not 
jealous, are you?

<character>LEELA</character>
What? No. No! Of course not!

<character>FRY</character>
Good, 'cause I consider my fake relationship 
with you a lot more meaningful.

<info>Leela grunts.</info>

<info>Countess de la Roca's Room.</info>

<character>COUNTESS</character>
Mind if I freshen up a bit before we 
go out?

<character>BENDER</character>
I was just about to suggest the same 
thing.  Pay dirt!

<info>He is about to put it in his chest cabinet but he hesitates. 
The Countess is behind him.</info>

<character>COUNTESS</character>
Lovely, isn't it?

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah. But only 93% as lovely as you.

<info>He puts it on her wrist.</info>

<character>COUNTESS</character>
Oh, Bender! Either that was a computing 
error or you're the most romantic robot 
I've ever met!

<info>Bender smirks.</info>

<info>Titanic Casino. Bender watches the Countess play a fruit machine 
while he sits at the bar.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I don't get it, iZac: That bracelet 
had a diamond the size of a racoon's 
brain. Why couldn't I steal it?

<character>IZAC</character>
It's obvious, Mr. B, you're in love.

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, it's true. But we're star-crossed 
robots. She, a countess built with a 
silver spoon in her mouth. And me, just 
a regular honest Joe.

<info>He walks off with the drinks.</info>

<character>IZAC</character>
Hey, you gonna pay for those?

<character>BENDER</character>
Hell, no!

<info>iZac presses something on his body and it beeps.</info>

<character>IZAC</character>
Security to bar area. Security to bar 
area.

<info>Two robot security guards rise from the floor and grab Bender.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Fellas, please. I'm in love!

<character>IZAC</character>
Rough him up!

<info>The security guards punch Bender. The Countess intervenes.</info>

<character>COUNTESS</character>
What are you doing?

<character>IZAC</character>
This penniless chump was stealing drinks, 
ma'am.

<character>COUNTESS</character>
I see. Here you are, sir ...  ... keep 
the change.

<character>IZAC</character>
You got it!

<info>The security guards punch Bender a couple more times then go 
back into the floor. Bender looks away from the Countess, ashamed.</info>

<info>Titanic Deck. The crew, Kif and the fat man are limboing. Zoidberg 
clears the pole.</info>

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Aha!

<info>Farnsworth has a go.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Go, Professor!

<character>AMY</character>
Lean back more!

<info>Farnsworth smacks straight into the pole.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Ow!

<info>Hermes and LaBarbara stand away from the game.</info>

<character>LABARBARA</character>
Come on, Hermes, you could out-limbo 
all of these people!

<character>HERMES</character>
Don't be a dog heart, woman. You know 
I can't. Not after what happened.

<info>Flashback. It's the 2980 Olympics. Hermes, representing Earth, 
is warming up ready for his limbo.</info>

<character>ANNOUNCER</character>
Now limboing for the Earth team: Hermes 
Conrad.

<info>As Hermes warms up, a boy in the crowd wearing a Hermes t-shirt 
shouts to him.</info>

<character>BOY</character>
(shouting) You're my hero, Hermes! I'm 
gonna be just like you!

<info>He jumps out of the stand and runs towards the limbo stick.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
No, boy, stop! It's too low! Your backbone 
can't take it!

<info>The boys starts to lean back.</info>

<character>BOY</character>
I'm just like Hermes! I'm just like--

<info>His back cracks, the crowd gasps and Hermes winces.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
(screaming) Nooo!

<info>Flashback ends. Hermes is crying. LaBarbara pats him on the 
back.</info>

<character>LABARBARA</character>
There, there. Now you don't have to 
limbo if you don't want. It doesn't 
make you any less of a man.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Though it did get me some action!

<info>Hattie hangs onto his arm.</info>

<character>HATTIE</character>
I like a man who's flexible!

<info>Enter Zapp.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Your attention, please. As captain of 
this vessel, the terrible burden of 
naming a limbo contest winner is mine 
and mine alone.

<character>KIF</character>
Shouldn't you be steering between the 
comets?

<character>ZAPP</character>
And the winner is, Leela!

<info>The crowd applauds and turns to Leela, who is still sat on her 
sunbed.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
But I didn't even limbo.

<character>ZAPP</character>
No matter. I know from personal experience 
how horizontal you can get. As your 
reward, you and that hairpile are invited 
to dine at the captain's table this 
evening.

<info>Fry hoots.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Bender and the Countess lean over the rail on the 
deck.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, now you know. I'm not actually 
rich. I'm a fraud. A poor, lazy, sexy 
fraud. This isn't even a real bow-tie 
-- it's magnetic.

<info>He takes the bow-tie off and throws it against the wall where 
it sticks.</info>

<character>COUNTESS</character>
Bender, I don't care whether you have 
money. I love you for your artificial 
intelligence and your sincerity simulator.

<character>BENDER</character>
You do? Really?

<info>The Countess nods. She and Bender kiss.</info>

<info>Montage: In some scenes lifted from Titanic the Countess lies 
on a sofa naked. Bender's finger makes printer noises as he draws 
her. He shows her the picture which looks like circuit diagrams. 
At tthe bow of the ship he holds her up at the railings but she 
is so heavy she ends up breaking his arms off. In the Titanic's 
hold they climb into an old hovercar and literally make sparks.</info>

<info>Titanic Buffet. A sign advertises "All You Can Eat Plus A Whole 
Chicken". Fry, Leela, Farnsworth and Hattie sit with Zapp around 
the captain's table wearing formal evening wear. Zapp wears a 
formal off-white DOOP jacket with medals.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
I like your style, Fry. You remind me 
of a young me. Not much younger, mind 
you. Perhaps even a couple of years 
older.

<character>FRY</character>
Thank you, sir.

<character>ZAPP</character>
As a gentleman, I must warn you. If 
you so much as glance at another woman, 
I'll be all over Leela like a fly on 
a pile of very seductive manure.

<character>FRY</character>
Well, rest assured, Leela's the only 
girl for me.

<info>Enter the Wongs.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Hey, Fry.

<character>LEELA</character>
Amy!

<character>AMY</character>
Leela!

<info>Amy has brought her parents. They sit down.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Ah, the family Wong. Our party is complete.

<info>Fry, Leela and Amy lean into each other and whisper to each 
other.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
(whispering) What are we gonna do? Fry 
can't pretend to be both our boyfriends.

<character>FRY</character>
(whispering) Sure I can. I learned how 
to handle delicate social situations 
from a little show called Three's Company.

<info>Zapp taps his glass.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
I'd like to impose a toast on the happy 
couple. Down the hatch!

<character>MRS WONG</character>
Hear, hear! Now lets have a kiss!

<character>ZAPP</character>
Yes, Fry. Plant one on your woman.

<character>FRY</character>
Um, let me think. Come and knock on 
our door, nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh. Uh, 
Mr Roper--

<info>Mr Wong thumps the table.</info>

MR <character>WONG</character>
What's the hold up? Kiss my daughter 
already!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Wait, I'm confused. Now tell me, Fry, 
which one of these ladies are you involved 
with?

<character>FRY</character>
Uh ...

<info>He hums the theme to Three's Company again. Enter Kif.</info>

<character>KIF</character>
Captain, may I have a word with you?

<character>ZAPP</character>
No.

<character>KIF</character>
It's an emergency, sir.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Come back when it's a catasrophe.  Oh, 
very well.

<info>He leaves with Kif.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Well, with Zapp gone and my parents 
still here, I suggest Fry give me a 
nice, convincing kiss.

<character>FRY</character>
Ah, now there's something we can all 
enjoy.

<info>He and Amy kiss. Leela grunts and turns away.</info>

<info>Titanic Wheel Room. The comets outside fly very close to the 
ship.</info>

<character>KIF</character>
Sir, remember your course correction?

<character>ZAPP</character>
No.

<character>KIF</character>
Well it's proving somewhat more suicidal 
than we'd initially hoped.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Kif, old friend, I don't know which 
disgusts me more: Your cowardice or 
your stupidity! We'll simply set a new 
course for that empty region over there. 
Near that black-ish hole-ish thing.

<info>He points at the black-ish hole-ish thing and grins. Kif's jaw 
drops.</info>

<info>Titanic Deck. Fry emerges from a room. Leela is standing looking 
over the railing.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, Leela, why'd you run off from dinner?

<character>LEELA</character>
I didn't run off. I had plenty of time 
to finish eating and stroll away while 
you were kissing Amy.

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, look, I'm not actually interested 
in her if that's what's bothering you.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, are you sure? I mean, she has two 
eyes, you have two eyes.

<character>FRY</character>
I know, we seem like a perfect match, 
but I just don't feel that way about 
her.

<info>The Titanic drifts past a nebula.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Nice nebula.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah.

<info>They look down at the couples on the decks below: Hermes and 
LaBarbara, Bender and the Countess, Mr and Mrs Wong, Dr Zoidberg 
and a jellyfish thing and Farnsworth and Hattie.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Look's like everybody's got somebody. 
Except me.

<character>FRY</character>
And me.

<info>They gaze into each other's eyes and lean in to kiss. The ship 
shakes, Leela loses her balance, head butts Fry and they both 
fall over.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
What was that?  Oh, my God! We're heading 
straight into a black hole.

<character>FRY</character>
Talk about a mood killer!

<info>Titanic Wheel Room.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Don't blame yourself, Kif. We were doomed 
from the start. Nothing remains now 
but for the captain to go down with 
his ship.

<character>KIF</character>
Why, that's surprisingly noble of you, 
sir.

<character>ZAPP</character>
No, it's noble of you, Kif!  As of now 
...  ... you're in command. Congratulations, 
captain!

<info>He runs off and hops into an escape pod and flies away. Kif 
sighs.</info>

<info>Titanic Deck. People are running about in a panic. The crew 
look at a map of the Titanic.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
<character>OK</character>. We just have to get from here to 
the escape pods.

<info>"Here" is the front of the ship. The escape pods are located 
at the back. The map breaks is half and the ship itself begins 
to tear in half.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(shouting) I'm too young to die!

<character>LEELA</character>
Come on, before its too late!

<character>BENDER</character>
You all go without me. I'm gonna take 
one last look around. You know, for, 
uh, stuff to steal.

<character>FRY</character>
You're going back or the Countess, aren't 
you?

<info>Bender pulls Fry aside.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(whispering) Alright, I am. But I don't 
want the others to know. If I don't 
come back, just say I died robbing some 
old man.

<character>FRY</character>
I'll tell them you went out prying the 
wedding ring off his cold, dead finger.

<character>BENDER</character>
I love you, buddy!

<info>Bender hugs Fry then runs off.</info>

<info>Cut to: Titanic Casino. The fruit machines and tables are overturned, 
fires burn and there is a huge hole in the middle of the floor. 
Bender runs in to the room.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Countess? Countess?

Countess (shouting) Bender!

<info>Bender looks around and sees the Countess's hat by the hole. 
He rushes over and peers into the hole. The Countess is trapped 
in a burning room. She is huddled in a corner away from the flames.</info>

<character>COUNTESS</character>
(shouting) I fell through the deck.

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Are you hurt, my sweet?

<character>COUNTESS</character>
(shouting) No. Luckily a family broke 
my fall.

<character>BENDER</character>
Just hang on! I'll take care of that 
fire!

<info>He grabs a fire hose and jumps through the hole.</info>

<info>Cut to: Titanic Room. Bender lands in the middle of the room 
and sprays the flames with water, extinguishing the fire. He 
leaves the hose and hugs the Countess.</info>

<character>COUNTESS</character>
Bender, you risked your life to save 
me.

<character>BENDER</character>
And I'd do it again. And perhaps a third 
time. But that would be it.  When we 
kiss, I feel like I'm standing waist 
deep in a pool of cold, rising water.

<info>They both look down and see they are standing waist deep in 
a pool of cold, rising water. They scream and shout as it gets 
closer to their heads.</info>

<info>Titanic Corridor. The crew run around a corner. Fry is carrying 
Farnsworth on his back.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Hurry! The escape pods should be just 
ahead!

<character>HERMES</character>
(gasping) Faster!

<info>There is a crash and the emergency airlock begins to close. 
The crew rush forward to get under it. Zoidberg dives and wedges 
his claw under it. It stops moving. Leela tries to lift it.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
It won't move. And the door release 
is on the other side.

<character>FRY</character>
Then we're dead meat. No one could squeeze 
under there!

<info>Hermes steps forward.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
No one, except a legendary limbo champion.

<info>He tears his tux off, revealing his Earth team vest underneath.</info>

<character>LABARBARA</character>
Oh, Hermes!

<info>Hermes leans back and his back creaks.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Ooh! It's been a while.  This one is 
for that little kid who's limboing up 
in heaven right now.

<info>LaBarbara pulls a food trolley in front of her and starts playing 
a dish cover with some spoons. Hermes squeezes under the door. 
The others cheer.</info>

<character>LABARBARA</character>
That's my man, alright, baby, limbo!

<character>HERMES</character>
I still got the moves! Zoidberg, lower 
the door another inch.

<character>LABARBARA</character>
Just go on through and hit the release, 
you hot dog!

<character>HERMES</character>
Yes, dear.

<info>The door slides up. They all cheer and rush through.</info>

<character>LABARBARA</character>
That's my man!

<character>AMY</character>
Yay, Hermes!

<character>HERMES</character>
Uh, can somebody help me up?

<info>Titanic Room. The water rises and completely covers the robots. 
They stop screaming.</info>

<character>COUNTESS</character>
Well, now what are we going to do?

<character>BENDER</character>
Wait a second. Aren't you a member of 
the yacht club?

<character>COUNTESS</character>
By God, you're right! I'm a class-3 
yacht.

<info>A propellor comes out from under her. Bender hops on and they 
rise to the surface.</info>

<info>Titanic Deck. Passengers are boarding the escape pods.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Thank God there are plenty of escape 
pods; We won't have to dress up like 
women and children.

<info>He takes his hat off and throws his lolly down. He and the others 
run into the escape pod. Leela and Fry stop outside.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
We can't leave yet. We've got to wait 
for Bender. The high gravity must be 
slowing down his looting.

<info>Amy's parents walk out onto the deck.</info>

<character>MRS WONG</character>
Amy!

<character>AMY</character>
Mom? Dad? You're alive!

MR <character>WONG</character>
Yeah but so what? The important thing 
is we found you a new man.

<character>MRS WONG</character>
A captain.

<character>AMY</character>
Uh, Mom, I don't--  Hi!

<character>KIF</character>
(sexfully) Hello!

<info>Kif picks Amy up and carries her to the escape pod. They kiss.</info>

<info>Cut to: Escape Pod. The ship begins to twist and distort.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I don't feel well!

<info>His head twists around like a squishy goo.</info>

<info>Cut to: Titanic Deck. Fry points at something in space.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Look! It's our nebula. Whenever I see 
it I'll think back to that moment when 
we almost--  Never mind!

<info>Hermes pokes his head out of the escape pod.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Everyone else is off the ship. Where 
in Babylon is Bender?

<character>LEELA</character>
I don't know. But we can't wait any 
longer.

<info>She gets into the pod and Fry follows. He looks back at the 
ship.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Goodbye, Bender.

<info>He closes the hatch. Bender and the Countess run out of the 
ship panting.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Wait for us!

<info>The escape pod lifts off and the airlock between it and the 
Titanic deck seals. Bender and the Countess leap from the deck, 
smashing through the glass airlock.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Escape Pod. Bender and the Countess float towards 
the pod and Bender reaches out his hand.</info>

<info>Cut to: Escape pod. It rocks as Bender grabs hold. Everyone 
is sat along the length of the pod and Leela steers.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Something's wrong. We're two metric 
tons overweight.

<character>AMY</character>
Well, its not me!

<info>Fry looks out of the airlock window.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Look!

<info>Everyone looks out the window to see Bender and the Countess.

[Cut to: Outside Escape Pod. The Titanic creaks and is sucked 
into the black hole. The escape pod starts to drift back towards 
it.</info>

<character>COUNTESS</character>
I'm slipping, Bender. The pull is too 
strong!

<info>She slips from Bender's grasp but he grabs on to her bracelet. 
It's all that holds them together. She screams.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I can't live without you. If you let 
go, I let go!

<character>COUNTESS</character>
No! You have too much to live for. It 
may hurt for a while but one day you'll 
share your love again. After all, it's 
shareware.

<character>BENDER</character>
Don't talk like that. Tragic romances 
always have a happy ending.

<info>The bracelet snaps and the Countess falls towards the black 
hole.</info>

<character>COUNTESS</character>
(shouting) Farewell!

<info>The black hole sucks her in.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Nooo!

<info>Cut to: Escape Pod. Bender walks in and closes the airlock behind 
him.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
She's gone.

<character>LEELA</character>
But she saved all our lives. Without 
her, we're light enough to get away.

<info>Bender slams his head against the airlock and cries.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows 
what happens in a black hole. It's possible 
she's still alive in another dimension 
somewhere. Right, Professor?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh, yes, absolutely!  Not a chance!

<info>He draws his finger across his neck and mimes being hung.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
At least I'll always have her bracelet! 
What do you think it's worth?

<info>Hermes takes a look at it.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
It's fake, mon!

<info>Bender cries as the the pod flies away into space.</info>

<info>THE END</info>
