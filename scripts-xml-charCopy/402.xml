<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry, Leela and Bender sit on the couch 
watching <character>TV</character>.</info>

<character>LINDA</character>
In what has become a winter tradition, 
members of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club 
today took the plunge into a river of 
liquid ammonia.

<info>The TV shows people jumping in.</info>

<character>MORBO</character>
There were no survivors.

<info>Linda chuckles.</info>

<character>LINDA</character>
Takes all kinds! And now, with his 
annual Xmas Message, here's the head 
of the Xmas Safety Council, the head 
of Walter Cronkite.

<character>CRONKITE</character>
Seasons warnings, Linda and Morbo.

<character>BENDER</character>
This guy's too trustworthy. What's his 
angle?

<character>CRONKITE</character>
In all the tinsel and terror of the 
holiday season we too often underestimate 
that murderous brute better known as 
Santa Claus. With images of last year's 
gingerbread massacre freshly baked into 
our memories, I remind you to bolt your 
doors, say goodbye to your pets and 
lock your children in the closet. This 
is Walter Cronkite saying "I told you 
so".

<info>Some wood appears over the <character>TV</character>. Hermes is boarding it up.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Sacred ball of West and Eastern Samoa. 
We've got to secure for Santa's arrival.

<info>Fry presses the remote.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Just as well. I'm getting tired of this 
wood show.

<info>Planet Express: Attic Room. Fry, Bender and Leela are struggling 
to get the armour-plated chimney cover over the chimney. Farnsworth 
walks in and shakes his fists.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Cover that fireplace, confound you! 
I've only a few years to live. I don't 
wanna spend them dead.

<character>LEELA</character>
We're pushing as hard as we can.

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh! Pushing!

<info>He pushes it the other way and hurls Fry and Leela over the 
top. Farnsworth sits down.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh, we're doomed! Every year we're doomed. 
Thanks be I had these bullet-proof shutters 
installed.

<info>He flips up the arm of the chair and presses a button.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Planet Express. Grey armour covers the building 
and knocks Amy off a ladder. She screams. A neon light on the 
hangar roof spells "Trespassers Will Be Shot" and Deck The Halls 
With Boughs Of Holly plays.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Attic Room.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Bring it on, Santa! That bloodthirsty 
cadaver junkie can't touch us as long 
as we're not stupid enough to leave 
this building.

<character>FRY</character>
Alright!

<character>LEELA</character>
Yeah!

<info>Bender breathes a sigh of relief.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
In a related matter, you'll be delivering 
this sack of children's letters directly 
to Santa at his death fortress on Neptune.

<info>Fry, Leela and Bender look shocked.</info>

<info>Outside Planet Express. The ship takes off and gets one of the 
landing legs stuck in the hangar roof. It pulls it free and flies 
away.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Fry, Leela and Bender are rummaging through 
the sack.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
These letters are real butt-nutters! 
Listen to this one: (reading) Dear 
Santa.

<info>Cut to: Girl's Bedroom.</info>

<character>GIRL</character>
(thinking and writing) Please, please 
don't bring me any gifts. The bicycle 
you fired at me last year from your 
bicycle gun really tore up my insides.

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Awful! Let's read some more. (reading) 
Dear Santa.

<info>Cut to: Boy's Bedroom.</info>

<character>BOY</character>
(thinking and writing) Please bring 
me a coffin for Grandpa. You choked 
him with a chestnut last year and he's 
beginning to smell a lot like Xmas if 
you know what I mean.

<info>A stiff corpse sits in a rocking chair by a window.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed 
to bring people together, not blow them 
apart!

<character>BENDER</character>
Sure, but who's going to do anything 
about it? Certainly not us. No, sir!

<character>FRY</character>
Certainly yes us! Uh-huh, sir! We've 
gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I 
remember.

<character>LEELA</character>
Fry's right. It's time to sit on Santa's 
lap -- and hard!

<info>Neptune Surface. The ship lands outside a little town called 
Jolly Junction at the north pole. There is a the sound of gunfire 
and barking dogs. The cargo bay lift comes down with Fry, Leela, 
Bender and the sack of letters. Leela sees something.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, look! A cute little welcoming party.

<info>Neptunians walk towards them holding hands.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIAN #1</character>
Hey! Wanna buy a tiny little kidney?

<character>NEPTUNIAN #2</character>
I'll let you punch me for a buck.

<character>FRY</character>
Uh, look, we've got mail for Santa. 
Are you his elves?

<character>NEPTUNIAN #2</character>
We're not elves. We're Neptunians.

<character>NEPTUNIAN #1</character>
We're just shrimp-y because he doesn't 
feed us.

<info>Neptunian #2 grabs Fry's hand and slaps himself with it.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIAN #2</character>
You hit me! You owe me a dollar.

<info>Jolly Junction. Neptunians are beating each other up and smashing 
bottles over each other's heads. Bender drags the sack down the 
icy street. Two Neptunians shout from in a house.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIAN #3</character>
Hey, you got any food? Old teabags, 
chewed gum, apple cores? Come on! We're 
starving here!

<character>FRY</character>
But you live in a gingerbread house.

<character>NEPTUNIAN #4</character>
Hey! It's food or shelter, not both.

<character>BENDER</character>
You lazy runts! Don't you get paid for 
making the toys?

<character>NEPTUNIAN #4</character>
Who said "toys"?

<info>All over the street Neptunians stop and look at Bender.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIANS</character>
Toys? Toys? Who said "toys"?

<character>NEPTUNIAN #2</character>
False alarm, folks! There's no reason 
to make toys since Santa judges everyone 
to be naughty.

<info>He points at the toy factory. It has a sign on it reading "Toy 
Works Closed. Coming Soon: Crackhouse".</info>

<character>FRY</character>
That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift 
of my boot up Santa's chimney. Where 
is he?

<character>NEPTUNIAN #2</character>
There! In his ice fortress.

<info>He points up a mountain. The fortress is at the top and lightning 
flashes around it.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
We'll need help getting in. Any volunteers?

<info>None of the Neptunians raise their hand.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIAN #1</character>
I'll help you!

<info>Neptunian #2 sees Neptunian #1 has raised both of their hands.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIAN #2</character>
Ah, phooey!

<info>Outside Ice Fortress. The Neptunians carry the sack of letters 
up the winding track in a wheelbarrow. They pass a cardboard 
Santa with his arm stretched out like at an amusement park. He 
holds a sign reading "If You Are Taller Than This Prepare To 
Die". A circular saw comes out of the hand and cuts their hats 
off. They pass some dogs who bark Jingle Bells at them. A bird 
lands on the electric fence and gets sizzled. Neptunian #2 picks 
it up.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIAN #2</character>
An omen?

<character>NEPTUNIAN #1</character>
Dinner!

<info>He takes it and puts it down his trousers.</info>

<info>Ice Fortress. Santa sits in a chair at an enormous screen. He 
laughs maniacally.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
Let's see who's been naughty, and who's 
been naughty!  Mobsters beating up a 
shopkeeper for protection money. Very 
naughty!  Shopkeeper's not paying their 
protection money. Exactly as naughty! 
I saw that!  Huh?

<info>He turns around and sees the Neptunians bring in the wheelbarrow.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIAN #2</character>
We brought your mail.

<character>SANTA</character>
Don't you ever knock? Who knows what 
naughty things I could be watching? 
I get New Orleans on this thing, you 
know!

<character>NEPTUNIAN #2</character>
Don't kill us!

<info>They run off. The sack rustles. Inside are Fry, Leela and Bender.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Santa's a robot, so we should be able 
to destroy him with a logical paradox. 
Bender, you'd better cover your ears.

<info>She tears open the bag and they leap out. Santa's eyes turn 
evil.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
Holy night! Intruders!

<info>He picks up a missile launcher and aims it at Leela.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Hold it Santa!  Consider this: You are 
programmed to destroy the naughty. But 
many of those you destroy are in fact, 
nice. I submit to you, that you are 
naughty, and logically, you must destroy 
yourself.

<info>Sparks come from Santa's neck. He jitters and his head explodes. 
Fry and Leela cheer but he immediately grows a new head.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
Nice try. But my head was built with 
paradox-absorbing crumple-zones.

<info>He raises the missile launcher again. Leela and Fry duck out 
the way. He aims it at Bender who is still covering his ears. 
He sees Santa and runs off. They run down a corridor and Santa 
shoots missiles at them. They duck into an elevator and a missile 
wedges itself in the door.</info>

<info>Cut to: Elevator. The crew are huddled in a corner. Leela frantically 
presses the down button. The elevator goes down and cuts off 
the top of the missile. It bleeps on the floor. The crew scream.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Ice Fortress. Fry and Bender run out followed 
by Leela who is carrying the warhead.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Wait! This is what we're running from!

<info>She tosses the warhead back into the elevator. They get on a 
sled but it doesn't move.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Faster! Faster!

<info>The bomb explodes and propels the sled down the track. Sentry 
towers shoot at them and the Santa cut-out sticks out its circular 
saw.</info>

<info>Cut to: Jolly Junction. The Neptunians are cooking their bird 
on a spit. The sled slides past and sprays snow over the fire. 
They speed on round a corner and hit the steps of the ship. They 
get off and run inside.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Everyone sits down and Leela presses 
some buttons. The engines start but the ship just shakes.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Why aren't we moving?

<info>Leela presses some more buttons and throws the wheel about.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
I don't know. Usually when I do stuff 
like this the ship moves.

<info>Cut to: Outside Ship. Santa is holding the ship by its engines, 
stopping it from moving.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
Ho ho-- Eh?

<info>He looks down. The radiation from the ships engines begins to 
melt the snow and ice beneath him and he sinks. He lets go of 
the ship and it lands again. The ice solidifies around him and 
the Neptunians and crew gather around.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
He's trapped!

<info>The Neptunians cheer. One runs forward and kicks him.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIAN #2</character>
Now we can make toys again!

<character>NEPTUNIANS</character>
(chanting) Toys! Toys! Toys!

<character>FRY</character>
And I can deliver them. Billions and 
billions in one night.

<info>He takes Santa's hat and puts it on.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
Hah! No human could do all that.

<character>FRY</character>
Evil Knievel could!

<character>SANTA</character>
Nuh-uh!

<character>BENDER</character>
Santa's right. We need some sort of 
robot.  Aw, crap! I'm some sort of robot.

<info>Fry puts his hat on Bender's head. The Neptunians throw their 
hats in the air.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIANS</character>
Hooray!  Hooray!  Hooray!

<info>Time Lapse.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
Bender can't be Santa! He wasn't built 
to Yuletide specifications.

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, yeah? Well I wasn't built to steal 
Leela's purse either.  But that didn't 
stop me.

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender!

<info>She takes it from him. Bender turns to the Neptunians.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Bow to your new Santa!

<character>NEPTUNIANS</character>
Our hero!

<info>Jolly Junction. The Neptunians sing and they skip towards the 
Toyworks.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIANS</character>
(singing) We are free and fairly sober,

With so many toys to build.

<info>Cut to: Toyworks.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIANS</character>
(singing) The machines are kinda tricky,

Probably someone will be killed,

But we gladly work for nothing--

<character>FRY</character>
(singing) Which is good because we don't 
intend to pay.

<character>ALL</character>
(singing) The elves are back to work 
today!

<character>NEPTUNIANS</character>
(singing) Hooray!

<info>They saw logs and they go down a conveyor belt.</info>

We have just a couple hours,

To make several billion gifts,

<info>A Neptunian boxes some toys. Another adds the polystyrene S's.</info>

And the labour isn't easy--

<character>LEELA</character>
(singing) Then you'll all work triple 
shifts,

You can make the job go quicker if you turn up the controls to 
super-speed.

<info>She turns a dial to Lucy.</info>

<character>FRY LEELA AND BENDER</character>
(singing) It's back to work on Xmas 
Eve!

<character>NEPTUNIANS</character>
(cheering) Hooray!

<character>LEELA</character>
(singing) And though you're cold and 
sore and ugly,

Fry (singing) Let my happy smile warm your hearts--

<character>NEPTUNIAN</character>
(singing) There's a toy lodged in my 
brain!

<info>There is a train in his head. Bender sits on the conveyor belt 
being sprayed Santa red by the Neptunians.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIANS</character>
(singing) We are getting awfully tired,

And we can't work any faster,

And we're very, very sorry--

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Why you selfish little bastards,

Do you want the kids to think that Santa's just a crummy, empty-handed 
jerk?

<info>He kicks a Neptunian.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIAN</character>
Ow!

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Then shut your yaps and back 
to work.

<info>Outside Toyworks. It is night. Santa's sleigh is being loaded 
with presents.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIANS</character>
(singing) Now it's very nearly Xmas,

And we've done the best we could,

<character>FRY</character>
(singing) These toys soldiers are poorly 
painted,

<character>LEELA</character>
(singing) And they're made from inferior 
wood.

<info>She snaps the soldier in half.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) I should give you all a beating,

But I really have to fly,

<info>Santa is still stuck in the ice.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
(singing) If I weren't stuck here frozen,

I'd harpoon you in the eye,

<character>NEPTUNIANS</character>
(singing) Now its back into our tenements,

To drown ourselves in rye,

<character>LEELA</character>
(singing) You did the best you could, 
br>I guess that some of these gorillas 
are OK,

<info>The Neptunians cheer.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIAN</character>
We're adequate!

<character>ALL</character>
(singing) The elves have rescued Xmas 
Day! Hooray!

<info>Bender flies overhead and around Santa's fortress. Some presents 
fall out of the sleigh and the fortress defences shoot them.</info>

<info>He flies towards Earth and over the streets of New New York. 
A snowman in the street is wearing a helmet and holding a gun 
with a bayonet.</info>

<info>Jeffery Grant's Rooftop. Bender throws the sack over his shoulder. 
He sees bars on the chimney.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(stupid voice) Duh! Gee, Bender, how 
you gonna get through these bars? (normal 
voice) I dunno, moron, suppose I bend 
them? (stupid voice) Duh, OK!

<info>He bends them.</info>

<info>Cut to: Jeffery Grant's Lounge. Bender falls into the fireplace. 
The family are hidden behind a couch.</info>

<character>GIRL</character>
Mommy! Mommy! Santa's through the perimeter!

<character>MRS. GRANT</character>
This is it, kids. Take your suicide 
pills so you won't suffer.

<character>BENDER</character>
No, wait! I'm the good Santa. I've got 
toys ... at very reasonable prices!

<character>JEFFERY</character>
Don't listen to him. He's the father 
of all lies and the uncle of all tricks!

<character>BENDER</character>
But I come bearing Tri-ominos!

<info>Mrs. Grant stands up and raises a crowbar.</info>

<character>MRS. GRANT</character>
Go for the shins!

<info>Bender runs back into the fireplace and scrambles up the chimney. 
The family hit him with metal objects and he cries out in pain.</info>

<info>Cut to: Jeffery Grant's Rooftop. Bender emerges from the chimney 
with his legs completely battered. He crawls into the sleigh.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(groaning) One down...

<info>Bender lands on another roof and climbs down the chimney.</info>

<info>Cut to: Petunia's Lounge. The room is dark. lights go on and 
Petunia stands in the doorway in her nightie.</info>

<character>PETUNIA</character>
Well, hello there, handsome!  Won't 
you have a cookie?

<character>BENDER</character>
Uh, don't mind if I do.  Ow! What's 
in these things?

<character>PETUNIA</character>
Why don't you slip into something more 
fiery?

<info>She blasts him with a flamethrower and he screams.</info>

<info>Cut to: Petunia's Rooftop. Bender flies out of the chimney and 
lands in a charred heap. His sack lands on him.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Ow!

<info>Bender flies the sleigh through the sky. The Kwanzaabot flies 
alongside.</info>

<character>KWANZAABOT</character>
Yo, Kringle! What happened to you, doll?

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, it's awful, Kwanzabot. Everyone 
hates me.

<character>KWANZAABOT</character>
At least they understand you, you know 
what I'm sayin'? Ain't nobody down with 
this Kwanza tip.

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey! Maybe you could lend me a hand 
with these deliveries.

<info>Kwanzaabot makes a noise like a "no" buzzer.</info>

<character>KWANZAABOT</character>
No time! I gotta hand out the traditional 
Kwanzaa book.  I've been givin' these 
out for 647 years!

<info>Planet Express: Attic Room. Amy flies up to the top of the Xmas 
tree and sprays lights from a can onto it. Leela puts candy canes 
on a bush. Nibbler emerges from it and eats them. Fry and Hermes 
stand by a bathtub of what looks like eggnog.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Ah! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma 
used to drink.  Ew! It went sour!

<info>Zoidberg sits up in the bath.</info>

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Can't I have a scented bath in peace?

<info>He scrubs his back with a brush.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Remember, Professor: Bender is Santa. 
So we don't need to hurt him, right?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yes, yes, yes. You sound like a broken 
mp3!

<info>Bender lands in thr fireplace.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Ho ho--  Ow!

<character>LEELA</character>
(shouting) Professor! Don't you remember 
what I told you?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(shouting) No!

<info>He shoots Bender again.</info>

<info>Planet Express Roof. Bender sits on the roof of the dome and

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) Oh, there's gotta be a better 
way.

<info>Cut to: New New York City Street. Bender walks past a Toys For 
Tots bin and empties the sack of presents into the sewer.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Bender you're a genius!

<info>Vyolet stands under the sewer grate waving a Barbie.</info>

<character>VYOLET</character>
This creates and unrealistic standard 
of beauty!

<info>She snorts.</info>

<info>Cut to: Alleyway. Bender is sat leaning against a dumpster holding 
a bottle of beer.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Now it's time for Santa to screw open 
his present!

<info>He opens the bottle and drinks the beer. From the end of the 
alleyway Smitty and <character>URL</character> watch.</info>

<character>SMITTY</character>
It's Santa! And we got him cornered!

<character>URL</character>
Aw, I smell a juicy promotion for me.

<character>SMITTY</character>
And a juicy re-hiring-back-onto-the-force 
for me!

<info>They shine a light at Bender.</info>

This Xmas Day session of court will 
come to order. The Honourable Judge 
Whitey presiding.

<info>Whitey takes his seat and bangs his gavel.</info>

<character>WHITEY</character>
Santa Claus, you stand accused of crimes 
against humanity. How do you plead?

<character>BENDER</character>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
There he is again!

<info>He shoots Bender in the back.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The Hyper-Chicken Lawyer questions the witness, 
a little girl.</info>

<character>HYPER</character>-<character>CHICKEN</character>
Now, Pramala, I know it's scary in that 
there witness box but t'ain't no need 
to fear me.  I'm sorry, I thought you 
was corn. Now, would you please point 
at that robot over there.  No further 
questions.  Daddy done good, huh?

<info>Time Lapse. Bender cross-examines the girl.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Isn't it true that you have been paid 
for your testimony?

<character>PRAMALA</character>
Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy.

<character>BENDER</character>
And yet you haven't said what I told 
you to say. How can any of us trust 
you?

<info>Pramala bursts into tears.</info>

<character>WHITEY</character>
Quit badgering the witness!

<info>The Hyper-Chicken jumps up.</info>

<character>HYPER</character>-<character>CHICKEN</character>
Badger? Where?

<info>He clucks around in a mad panic. Whitey bangs his gavel.</info>

<character>WHITEY</character>
Whereas I have a ham dinner with mayonnaise 
waiting for me at my mansion, I find 
the defendant guilty.  Santa Claus, 
I hereby sentence you to be executed 
at sundown.

<info>He bangs his gavel. Bender is shocked. Smitty and <character>URL</character> lead him 
away.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
It's not fair. I just hope that dumb 
chicken is ashamed of himself.

<info>Cut to: Outside Famous Original Ray's Superior Court. The Hyper-Chicken 
is on the roof, crowing.</info>

<info>Stattica Robot Penitentiary. Smitty and <character>URL</character> lead Bender into

<character>SMITTY</character>
Deactivated robot walking. We got a

<info>A robot leans through his cell bars and stops them.</info>

<character>ROBOT</character>
Hey, Santa, when you see the Robot Devil, 
tell him I'm-a comin'!

<info>They past the next cell. The Robot Devil is inside.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, that guy said to tell you that--

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
I heard him!

<info>Neptune Surface. The ship lands outside Jolly Junction. The 
steps squash a Jack-in-the-Box and it plays Pop Goes The Weasel. 
Fry and Leela are greeted by the Neptunians, now wearing summer 
gear.</info>

<character>NEPTUNIAN #1</character>
Greetings, masters. My companion and 
I made lots of toys.

<info>Leela pushes him aside.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Outta my way, shrimp-oh. We're here 
to bring Santa back so we can prove 
Bender's innocent.

<info>Time Lapse. Leela cuts through the ice around Santa with a chainsaw.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
Do what you will. But we'll see who 
has the last ho.

<info>Fry, Leela and the Neptunians use planks and candy canes to 
lift Santa out of the ground in one solid block of ice.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
There.

<info>The ice starts to melt.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, no! The ice is melting!

<character>LEELA</character>
The pollution from the factory. It caused 
a greenhouse effect.

<character>NEPTUNIAN #1</character>
That would explain this heat.

<character>FRY</character>
And your breezy short-shorts!

<character>NEPTUNIAN #2</character>
Uh, yeah! That would explain it.

<info>Santa breaks through the melting ice. Everyone screams and runs. 
Fry and Leela run into the Toyworks.</info>

<info>Cut to: Toyworks. Neptunians are making toys. Santa runs in, 
shooting a laser and the elves run. Fry and Leela scream and 
jump onto the conveyor belt and over toy soldiers like hurdles. 
Santa follows, still shooting. Fry and Leela jump off the end 
of the conveyor belt. Leela turns one of the soldiers bayonets 
upwards and it impales Santa. He groans.</info>

<info>Cut to: Neptune Surface. Fry and Leela run up the steps.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Leela powers up the ship and it takes 
off and tears away from Neptune.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hurry! We've gotta think of another 
way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!

<character>LEELA</character>
Especially for Bender.

<info>Santa is crouching on the roof of the ship.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
Look out, Earth. I'm dreaming of a red 
Xmas.

<info>He laughs.</info>

<info>Stattica Robot Penitentiary. Bender is being strapped to a table 
for his execution by Magnexecutioner. He is moved forward between 
two giant magnets.</info>

<character>POOPENMEYER</character>
Ah, good old Maggie!  Eh? When I pull 
this switch, these powerful electromagnets 
will tear you limb-from-limb, killing 
you in the most humane possible manner.

<character>BENDER</character>
But, Mr. Mayor, that doesn't sound humane.

<character>POOPENMEYER</character>
It is for the witnesses because it's 
not boring!  The instant this random 
number generator reaches zero, you'll 
be executed.

<character>BENDER</character>
Aw!

<info>Poopenmeyer presses a button. The generator starts displaying 
numbers.</info>

<character>POOPENMEYER</character>
Ten. Three. Twelve. Three again.

<info>Enter Leela.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Stop the execution!

<character>BENDER</character>
Leela!

<character>POOPENMEYER</character>
Fifteen. Negative eight.

<character>LEELA</character>
You got the wrong Santa. And I'll prove 
it.

<info>Fry walks in dressed in a Santa outfit.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I'm Santa Claus!

<info>The witnesses gasp.</info>

<character>POOPENMEYER</character>
What? Twenty-seven.

<info>Enter Hermes in a Santa outfit.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
No. I'm Santa Claus.

<character>POOPENMEYER</character>
Six.

<info>Enter Amy and Farnsworth in Santa outfits.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
(disguised, deeper voice) We're also 
Santa Claus.

<info>Enter Zoidberg dressed as Jesus, surrounded by a white light.</info>

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
And I'm his friend Jesus!

<character>FRY</character>
Your Mayorness, if you execute him, 
you have to execute all of us.

<character>POOPENMEYER</character>
You people aren't Santa. You're not 
even robots! Ninety-one. How dare you 
lie in front of Jesus!  Hey! Zero!

<info>He throws the switch and sends the electricity through the electromagnets. 
Bender's arms and legs are pulled to them.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
No! Not the magnets!  (singing) Swing 
low, sweet chariot, coming for to carry 
me home.  Swing low sweet--

<character>FRY</character>
This is horrible.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
But it's not boring!

<info>Santa's sleigh crashes through the wall, knocking off one of 
the electromagnets.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
Ho ho ho!

<info>He shoots the other electromagnet off the wall. Everyone scatters 
except for Fry, Leela, Bender and Poopenmeyer. Fry and Leela 
dive behind some rubble.</info>

<character>POOPENMEYER</character>
My God! The real Santa! Get him, Jesus!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
I help those who help themselves.

<info>Santa shoots at him and he runs out. The sleigh lands.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Santa! You saved my life. Please don't 
kill me!

<info>Santa laughs.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
I'm not here to kill you, Bender! I 
need you to help me save Xmas.

<character>BENDER</character>
Gee whiz, Santa! You want me to help 
you?

<character>FRY</character>
Don't do it! He's evil!

<character>SANTA</character>
I know he is but I have no choice. I'm 
running late and if I don't complete 
my brutal rampage, well, it just wouldn't 
be Xmas. I guess what I'm asking is: 
Bender, won't you join my slaying tonight?

<character>BENDER</character>
Well ... 'tis the season!

<info>Santa pulls him out of his constraints and puts him in the sleigh. 
He climbs in and the sleigh flies off.</info>

<info>New New York City Streets. Santa flies the sleigh down a street 
and Bender smashes lights with a blernsball bat. Then Santa shoots 
a missile at a Stinky Stork's Diaper Service truck and it explodes, 
showering people with diapers. Scruffy puts up an umbrella.</info>

<character>MAN</character>
My hair!

<character>WOMAN</character>
My wedding cake!

<info>Santa and Bender laugh.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
Let it snow!

<info>They fly around a corner and Bender holds handfuls of toys.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Merry Xmas, kids!

<info>He throws the toys through windows and walls. Santa shoots a 
bike at a little girl. Bender laughs.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Attic Room. The staff and LaBarbara are sat 
in darkness. Outside, buildings burn and police car sirens wail.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
This wangs chun! After all the good 
we tried to do, Xmas turned out as rotten 
as ever.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
No heat.

<character>AMY</character>
No power.

<character>HERMES</character>
Huddled together in fear like lice in 
a burning wig.

<info>He hugs LaBarbara. Zoidberg and Fry are also huddled together.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Wait a second! Maybe your futuristic 
Xmas isn't so rotten after all.

<character>LEELA</character>
What are you talking about, you crouton? 
You said it yourself: Xmas should be 
about bringing people together, not 
blowing them apart.

<character>FRY</character>
But don't you see? Fear has brought 
us together. That's the magic of Xmas!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
That's a big crock of--  Hold me!

<info>Everyone huddles together.</info>

<info>In the sky, Bender whips the reindeer.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
On, Trasher! On, Smasher!  Hey, Kwanzaabot, 
where you off to?

<character>KWANZAABOT</character>
Ah, you didn't hear about it? Chanukah 
Zombie's having a luau at the B'nai 
Brith! You comin'?

<character>BENDER</character>
Word!

<info>The Kwanzaabot flies off. Santa pulls out a present.</info>

<character>SANTA</character>
By the way, Bender, here's a small token 
of my appreciation for being Santa while 
I was trapped in the ice.

<info>Bender takes the gift and cheers. He opens it.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, chief, you screwed up. There's 
nothing in here.

<character>SANTA</character>
Oh, it might appear empty but the message 
is clear: Play Santa again and I'll 
kill you next year!  Ho ho ho!

<info>THE END</info></xml>
