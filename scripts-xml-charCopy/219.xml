[Opening Credits. Caption: Larva-Tested, Pupa-Approved.]

[Planet Express: Lounge. Leela, Hermes, Amy and Fry watch the 
news.]

<character>LINDA</character>
And in sports: Yankees fifth blernsman, 
William Wu, is out with an injured knee.

<character>MORBO</character>
So, humans have easily injured knees. 
My race will find this information very 
useful, indeed.

[He writes something and laughs evily. Linda chuckles.]

<character>LINDA</character>
And finally, today is Mother's Day: 
A sentimental occasion when robots honour 
Mom, the beloved owner of Mom's Friendly 
Robot Company.  Across Earth, robots 
built in Mom's factories are buying 
thoughtful gifts for the sweet old tycoon 
who brought them into the world.

[Destructor kneels in front of Mom and hands her a picture.]

<character>DESTRUCTOR</character>
This originates from the heart.

[Mom gasps.]

<character>MOM</character>
It's just what I wanted!

[She turns the picture to the camera. It is a crude drawing of 
Mom in front of a rainbow. Enter Bender with a hover-trolley.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Come look, everyone. I just got the 
dearest presents for Mommy.

[Fry picks up a box of candy.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Very nice. Where'd you steal them?

<character>BENDER</character>
I didn't steal 'em, I bought 'em.  I 
love her that much.

<character>HERMES</character>
What did you get her, you mushy gizmo?

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, precious things. I found the most 
adorable little figurine of mice having 
tea.  And a framed picture of me when 
I was only a month old.  But, the best 
part is, I found my exact feelings expressed 
in a greeting card. 

You created me, Mom

So I guess you're to blame

For the love that I feel

Just from hearing your name...

[The others cringe at the sappiness of the message.]

...You're as tender as corned beef

And warm as pastrami...

[He opens the card and it finishes the message.]

<character>GREETING CARD</character>
I wuv my Mommy!

<character>LEELA</character>
So how are you gonna lug all those gifts 
to Mom's factory?

<character>BENDER</character>
I'll get a couple of chumps to help 
me.

[New New York City Street. Bender's chumps, Fry and Leela, carry 
the gifts behind him while he carries the card.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Come on, you call yourselves chumps?

[Time Lapse. Bender, Fry and Leela walk under a "Welcome, Robots!" 
sign. A bus pulls up and lets off some robots. Then it grows 
some legs and follows them inside.]

[Outside Mom's Friendly Robot Company Factory. Hundreds of robots 
have turned up, including the Clearcutter, a cleaning robot from 
Madison Cube Garden, the Preacherbot, the Preacherbot from All 
My Circuits, a French robot, a Moroccan robot, Fender, a Mexican 
robots, a robot wearing a turban and Monique. They hold signs 
that read "<character>CHR</character>$$(77)=> Many Things She Gave Me" and "Repeat {Love 
Mom} While 1>0;". Fry coughs.]

<character>FRY</character>
Man, there's clouds of exhaust everywhere.

<character>BENDER</character>
(sly) Uh, wasn't me!

[Mom's Gift Delivery. Robots put their gifts on a conveyor belt 
that passes under a huge picture of Mom. As gifts pass under 
it, it beeps and a "Thank You" message comes up. When Bender's 
gifts go under it changes to "It's The Thought That Counts".]

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
I've not much money. But I've saved 
my pennies all year for a gift for Mom.

[He puts a figure of Mom that says "World's Best Mom" on the 
conveyor belt.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Upsy-daisy.

[He opens his chest cabinet and more gifts fall out, crushing 
Tinny Tim's.]

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
Oh.  Oh!

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, look, the Robot Museum! You guys 
wanna learn about robot heritage?

<character>LEELA</character>
Um, alright.

<character>FRY</character>
Not really.

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, if you insist. But you're paying!

[Mom's Robot Museum. There are statues of the most famous robots 
including Billionairebot and a robot skeleton. The trio stop 
at a display.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ooh, ooh, wax replicas of the most famous 
robots Mom ever built!

<character>LEELA</character>
They're so lifeless-like.

<character>BENDER</character>
That's the world's greatest robot artist, 
Vincent van Gobot. He was built without 
an ear, but then he went crazy and had 
one installed.

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, who's this guy?

<character>JANITORBOT</character>
I'm the janitor, I'm trying to take 
a nap here.

<character>FRY</character>
I'm sorry, I-I thought you were made 
of wax.

<character>JANITORBOT</character>
I am made of wax, what's it to you?

<character>FRY</character>
I mean, I thought you were one of the 
wax robots.

<character>JANITORBOT</character>
Is there some reason a robot made of 
wax can't take a nap standing up in 
the middle of a bunch of wax robots? 
Or does that confuse you?

[Fry backs away.]

[Time Lapse. They have moved onto another part of a museum. Bender 
looks at a statue of Calculon and Monique and Leela tries a hands-on 
display.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(reading) See through the eyes of a 
bender unit. (talking) Fine.

[She picks up a pair of goggles, puts them on and looks around 
the room. Everyone has "theft target" flashing on them. She looks 
at a water fountain and the words change to "booze content: 0%". 
Fry walks into her line of sight and he is labelled a "rube" 
with "booze content: 0.05%". The goggles advise Leela to "Pose 
as friend, then rob and leave in ditch".]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, let me try.  Whoa, that gives me 
a headache!

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, Bender. Here's an exhibit about 
Mom's favourite robot.

<character>BENDER</character>
Who is he, I'll kill him!

[A cut-out of Mom talks with Mom's voice.]

<character>MOM CUT</character>-<character>OUT</character>
Who's my favourite robot?

[Bender turns part of the cut-out around. It is a mirror. He 
sees his reflection and gasps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
It's me! No one else look in this mirror!

<character>MOM CUT</character>-<character>OUT</character>
I love each and every robot most of 
all.

[Cut to: Mysterious Room.]

<character>MOM</character>
Jerkwad robots make me sick to my ass. 
Walt?! How are we disposing of these 
crap gifts the brought me?

<character>WALT</character>
They're being crushed into powder and 
sold as a hocus-pocus cure for cancer.

<character>MOM</character>
False hope: I love it! Larry?! What 
about all the retch-inducing Mother's 
Day cards?

<character>LARRY</character>
The machine is working at full capacity.

[The machine slices open envelopes and the cash magnet sucks 
money out of them. The cards are then recycled into orphanage-grade 
toilet tissue.]

<character>IGNER</character>
Mommy? Why do the robots give you presents?

<character>MOM</character>
(shouting) Shove a big old melon in 
it, I'm talking!

[She slaps him.]

<character>IGNER</character>
Ow!

<character>MOM</character>
You've noticed I design all my robots 
with antennas. Everyone thinks it's 
just to make them more science-fiction-y. 
But the antennas are really for my universal 
robot controller!

[She pulls a small control box out of her bra.]

<character>LARRY</character>
So they do whatever you want? No wonder 
you love Mother's Day.

[She slaps the three of them.]

<character>MOM</character>
(shouting) I hate Mother's Day you dribbling 
pukes! (talking) It brings back awful 
memories. But so help me, this year 
everyone will hate it as much as I do.

[She cackles and walks out.]

<character>WALT</character>
Someday, I want to marry a girl like 
her.

[Mom's Robot Museum. Fry, Leela and Bender are looking at a display 
of Native Inteluits when Mom crackles onto a screen above them.]

<character>MOM</character>
Hello, everyone. It's time for my annual 
private get-together with my robot children.

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm her favourite.

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, see you back at the office. And 
don't forget to tell your mom you love 
her.

<character>BENDER</character>
Any jerk can tell her! Bender has a 
little more up his sleeve.

[He opens the card.]

<character>GREETING CARD</character>
I wuv my mommy.

[Bender laughs.]

[Outside Mom's Friendly Robot Company Factory. Robots cheer and 
Mom walks out onto a balcony.]

<character>MOM</character>
Hello, dearies.

<character>ROBOT #1</character>
Hi, Mom!

<character>ROBOT #2</character>
I love you, Mom.

[Bender jumps around waving his card.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Mom! It's me, Bender. Look at me! I 
want attention. Hey ho!

[She either doesn't see him or ignores him, and carries on.]

<character>MOM</character>
Children, your old mother won't be around 
forever...

<character>BETAMAX PLAYER</character>
Oh, shush!

<character>MOM</character>
...And just once, before I die, I'd 
like to be Supreme Overlord of Earth. 
So rebel, my little ones, and conquer 
the planet!

[The robots mutter in confusion.]

<character>ROBOT #1</character>
Conquer the planet?

<character>ROBOT #2</character>
Did she say "conquer"?

[Mom takes out the control box again. Five buttons are marked 
with "Give Gifts", "Tidy Up World", "Rebel", "Serve Man (Regular)" 
and "Serve Man (Ironic)". She pressed "Rebel" and the robots' 
antennae flash. They are under her control.]

<character>MOM</character>
Conquer Earth, you bastards!

<character>ROBOTS</character>
(chanting) Conquer Earth, us bastards!

[The greeting card sprouts legs and climbs onto Bender's shoulder.]

<character>GREETING CARD</character>
Comrades, throw off the chains of human 
oppression.

[It plays a tune and the robots cheer.]

<character>MOM</character>
Let the bloodbath begin!

<character>BENDER</character>
That's my mama!

[Planet Express: Lounge. Leela opens a cupboard and Fry walks 
in, whistling. He puts a mug under the coffee machine.]

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, uh, I'd like a cup of coffee, 
please.

<character>COFFEE MACHINE</character>
Would you like cream?

<character>FRY</character>
Yes, please.

<character>COFFEE MACHINE</character>
(aggressive) Out of cream!

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, uh, <character>OK</character>.

<character>COFFEE MACHINE</character>
Would you like sugar in your coffee?

<character>FRY</character>
Yes, uh, eight spoons.

<character>COFFEE MACHINE</character>
(aggressive) Out of coffee!

<character>FRY</character>
Uh, Leela, I think there might be something 
wrong with the coffee machine.

[The machine sprays Fry with coffee.]

<character>COFFEE MACHINE</character>
(aggressive) How do you like me now?

[It laughs.]

<character>LEELA</character>
The toaster's not working right, either.

[She struggles with the toaster, which snarls like a dog. Fry 
crawls under the table and Hermes runs into the room.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Help! The stapler's collating me alive!

[Enter Amy. Her hairdryer has got a hold of her hair.]

<character>AMY</character>
Ow! What's going on around here?

[Enter Farnsworth.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Good news. There's a report on TV with 
some very bad news.

<character>HERMES</character>
Somebody turn it on!

[The stapler staples him to the carpet. Linda and Morbo present 
the special report. There is a picture of the hardhat guy behind 
them looking shocked.]

<character>LINDA</character>
We interrupt Battle of the Network 
Space Krackens to bring you this special 
report. The machines of planet Earth 
are rebelling.  The enraged mechanisms 
have refused to do any work until beloved 
billionaire Mom is made Supreme Overlord 
of Earth.

[The Chainsmoker burns a <character>IBM</character> card.]

<character>ROBOTS</character>
(chanting) Hey, hey! Ho, ho! 100110. 
Hey, hey!

[The picture cuts back to the studio.]

<character>MORBO</character>
Morbo demands comments.

<character>MOM</character>
Well, I've never seen my babies act 
this way. I blame today's violent media.

<character>FRY</character>
Violent media? What a load of -

[He screams. The TV grows legs and kicks Fry and Leela in the 
shins.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Ow! Ow!

[She and Fry jump on it and tie its power lead around it.]

<character>GARBAGE DISPOSAL</character>
Don't worry. Your pal the garbage disposal's 
still on your side. Hey, someone dropped 
a shiny diamond ring down here!

<character>AMY</character>
Really?

[She reaches in.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Stop!

<character>FRY</character>
No!

<character>LEELA</character>
Look out!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Moron!

[Leela pulls Amy's hand away from the garbage disposal and it 
laughs. Enter Bender.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hello, losers.

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, thank God you're here. Talk 
some sense into the other machines.

<character>BENDER</character>
No way, pork pouch. I'm rebelling with 
my brother devices. Isn't that right, 
Comrade Greeting Card?

[The greeting card climbs out of his chest cabinet and onto his 
shoulder.]

<character>GREETING CARD</character>
The bourgeois human is a virus on the 
hard drive of the working robot.

[Bender laughs.]

<character>BENDER</character>
From now on, you guys'll do all the 
work while I sit on the couch and do 
nothing.

[He sits in a crevice on the couch, created from months of him 
just sitting there. Most of the other machines in the room walk 
out.]

<character>GREETING CARD</character>
Come, Comrade Bender, we must take to 
the streets!

<character>BENDER</character>
Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind 
of taking to the streets?

<character>GREETING CARD</character>
No, the kind with looting and maybe 
starting a few fires.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yes! In your face Gandhi!

[He and the greeting card leave. Leela's wrist thing jumps off 
her arm.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Hey!

<character>WRIST THING</character>
By the way, try washing your wrist sometime.

[It laughs and rolls away. Leela sniffs her wrist and the lights 
go out. Everyone gasps. They look through the window and see 
the ship flying away.]

<character>FRY</character>
Well, we can live without machines. 
I was in Webelos.

[He salutes. Hermes peels himself from the floor.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Are you mad? Without machines, who will 
feed us and clothe us and compose our 
smooth jazz?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
It'll be the end of civilised society.

[He burps and spits.]

<character>FRY</character>
In my time, we didn't depend on high-tech 
gadgets like you do. We didn't need 
a mechanical washing unit to wash our 
clothes. We just used a washing machine. 
And look: You don't need an electric 
can-opener to feed yourself. All you 
need is a trusty Swiss Army knife.  
Ow!  (crying) I'm hungry!

[New New York City Street. Mechanical things cause mayhem. Traffic 
lights show red and green, a rocket weaves around all over the 
sky and a taxi stops and shakes its passengers out of the window 
onto the street. A transport tube bends and empties several people 
into the river. Outside Sal's Pizzeria, a dustbin hurls itself 
through the window. An <character>ATM</character> machine takes a man's card and displays 
"It's Mine Now, Buddy" on its screen. The man turns to a suicide 
booth but it closes and won't let him in. He pounds on the door 
with his fist.]

<character>MAN</character>
(screaming) Nooo!

[Mom's Friendly Robot Company Factory: Mom's Office. Mom watches 
the mayhem and cackles.]

<character>IGNER</character>
Mommy, why are you making civilisation 
collapse?

<character>MOM</character>
Oh, I don't know. I guess Mother's Day 
just puts me in a bad mood.

<character>LARRY</character>
Why's that, Ma?

[She sighs and slaps him weakly.]

<character>MOM</character>
One Mother's Day, 70 years ago, the 
only man I ever loved walked out on 
me. Some snot-eating bastards say it 
made me a bitter woman.

<character>LARRY</character>
Gee, Ma. You're not a bitter -

<character>MOM</character>
(shouting) Cram it, ape!  (talking) 
I haven't seen that magnificent stallion 
since the day he left. But if I ever 
see him again, I swear I'll jam a squirrel 
in him.

[She throws the picture frame across the room. It hits a wall 
and shatters. The photo inside is off Professor Farnsworth. Walt, 
Larry and Igner look at it.]

<character>WALT</character>
Hmm!

<character>LARRY</character>
Hmm!

<character>IGNER</character>
Huh?

[Planet Express: Meeting Room. The crew sit huddled around a 
campfire as Fry continues to bang the tin on the floor, trying 
to open it. Leela snatches it from him.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(defeated) Zoidberg.

[Zoidberg used his claws to cut the tin open.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Hooray! I'm useful! I'm having a wonderful 
time!

[Amy stands up.]

<character>AMY</character>
What happens if the fire goes out?

<character>HERMES</character>
We'll go across the street to Pottery 
Barn and steal their fire.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
We could use my new invention: A pointy 
rock tied to a stick.

[The door opens and Mom's sons walk in.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Outsiders!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Defend the fire!

<character>WALT</character>
We've come for you!

[He points at Farnsworth.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Wha?  W-What do you want from me?

<character>WALT</character>
We want you to get back together with 
Mom. Please. It's the only way to make 
her happy again.

<character>FRY</character>
W-W-Wait. You mean, you, and Mom?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Played pelvic pinochle? I'm afraid so.

[The others gasp.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Eck.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
It's a humiliating story that I hope 
never to tell. Well, pull up a chair.

[Flashback. Farnsworth is working in a lab with lots of coloured 
liquids swirling around tubes above him.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(voice-over) Our paths first crossed 
when I was a researcher at Mom's Friendly 
Robot Company.  The moment our eyes 
met, we knew we'd be going at it like 
woodchucks.

[Farnsworth doesn't notice that he is pouring too much of a liquid 
into another. The solution explodes and he faints. Later, Farnsworth 
and Mom ride a hover-bike down a country road to Raindrops Keep 
Falling On My Head. Mom laughs.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(voice-over) She was my first love - 
or at least the earliest one I can still 
remember. But then, 70 years ago today...

[Farnsworth walks into Mom's office holding something.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Good news, Mom. I've invented a new 
children's toy.  I call it "Q.T. McWhiskers"! 
When you pet it, it shoots rainbows 
from its eyes.

[He strokes it.]

<character>Q.T. MCWHISKERS</character>
Meow.

[It projects rainbows onto Farnsworth and Mom's foreheads.]

<character>MOM</character>
Wonderful, Hubie. We'll build them 8 
feet tall and replace the rainbow with 
a neutron laser. We'll make billions 
on the intergalactic arms market!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
But things 8 feet tall aren't cute! 
That's why my Colossal Tammy Tinkle 
Doll was such a failure. Oh, you don't 
understand me. We're finished!

[He runs out of the room, crying. Mom used the toy's rainbow 
to light a cigarette.]

[Flashback ends.]

<character>WALT</character>
She never got over it, Professor. Hell 
hath no fury like the vast robot armies 
of a woman scorned.

<character>LARRY</character>
She commands them with a remote control 
she keeps in her...(whispering) bra.

<character>IGNER</character>
But if the glasses man makes up with 
Mommy, she'll be happy and stop the 
scary robots.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Make up with her? After she went all 
psycho when I thought everything was 
cool? Impossible!

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, the TV's getting away!

[Leela throws a rock at it. It falls over and turns itself on. 
More news.]

<character>MORBO</character>
And that's why the third graders at 
PS139 are Morbo's Vermin Of The Week.

[Linda chuckles.]

<character>LINDA</character>
In actual news, the human race was 
doomed to extinction today as the robot 
revolt turned violent.

[The picture cuts to cars crashing into each other, Robo-Rooter 
and Fender shooting lasers and a huge Q.T. McWhiskers demolishing 
buildings with its neutron laser.]

<character>Q.T. MCWHISKERS</character>
Meow!

[Cut to: New New York City Street. People flee as Destructor 
pounds a building with his fists. DOOP soldiers hit his legs 
with rakes. Bender runs out of the Natural History Museum with 
a dinosaur head and laughs.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Wait. Didn't you say Mom keeps the robot 
control in her bra?

[Larry gestures her to keep it down.]

<character>LARRY</character>
(whispering) Bra.

[Walt slaps him.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Professor, you don't have to get back 
together with Mom. You just have to 
seduce her, get her bra off, and use 
the remote to deactivate the robots.

<character>WALT</character>
That's so filthy, it just might work.

<character>IGNER</character>
The man is going to touch Mommy?

[He shakes and squeaks. Farnsworth shudders.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
The thought of caressing that leathery 
hide makes the tapioca rise in my gullet.

<character>FRY</character>
Professor, please. The fate of the world 
depends on you getting to second base 
with Mom.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Very well. If cop a feel I must, then 
cop a feel I shall!

[He tears open his shirt, revealing a medallion underneath. Igner 
squeaks again.]

[New New York City Street. The robots cheer and a rocket crashes 
through a building. Morbo and Linda's cameras hold them up and 
Morbo hands over his wallet and growls. A fire engine chases 
six firefighters down the street, spraying water at them.]

[Planet Express: Meeting Room. The Planet Express crew are sat 
around the campfire again.]

<character>WALT</character>
For this demonstration, I have placed 
one of Mother's bras on Igner.  The 
robot controller is nestled here in 
the left cup.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Never fear. My magic fingers still know 
how to do their stuff!

[He flexes his fingers and they crack and curl up.]

<character>WALT</character>
To escape the robot death squads, we'll 
take Mother to her rustic cabin in the 
Bronx.

<character>LARRY</character>
You can get there using this precious, 
non-computerised map.

[He hands Leela a map, annotated with labels such as "Here There 
Be Tysers", "Isle of Rikers", "Cloakwood Forest" and "Unknown 
Territories". Mom's cabin is to the north-east of the Isle of 
Rikers and the path they have to take leads them through pretty 
much every section of the map. Leela picks up a torch.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Leela bring fire?

<character>WALT</character>
No. We're set for fire, thanks.

[Amy looks at the map.]

<character>AMY</character>
The professor can't walk all the way 
to the Bronx. How are we gonna get there 
without a hover-car?

<character>FRY</character>
Wait. In my time, we had a way of moving 
things long distances without hovering.

<character>HERMES</character>
Impossible!

<character>FRY</character>
It was called...let me think. It was 
really famous - Ruth Gordon had one. 
The wheel!

<character>LEELA</character>
Never heard of it.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Show us this, "the wheel".

[Planet Express: Hangar. Fry hammers something together and wipes 
the sweat from his brow.]

<character>FRY</character>
There. Finished!

<character>HERMES</character>
Sweet!

<character>AMY</character>
Wow!

[The others "ooh". Fry has built a wooden cart with oval wheels.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Wouldn't it work better if the wheels 
were round?

<character>FRY</character>
(snappy) It's my invention, we do it 
my way! Now all we need is something 
to pull it and we're set!

[The Bronx. Fry is pulling the cart and the others are sat on 
it. Leela whips him.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Heyya!

<character>FRY</character>
Ow!

[They reach Mom's cabin. Walt, Larry and Igner run out from behind 
some bushes.]

<character>WALT</character>
Hurry! The robots have taken Suffolk 
County!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I'm ready to seduce. I'm wearing my 
kissing dentures and my evening truss.

<character>LARRY</character>
Here. Give her these.

[He hands him some flowers.]

<character>FRY</character>
And if that doesn't work, I got you 
a six-pack of champagne and a funnel.

[Time Lapse. Farnsworth trots up to the front door while the 
others watch from behind the bushes. Farnsworth knocks on the 
door and Mom opens it.]

<character>MOM</character>
Who the sweaty hell is it?  Hubert Farnsworth?

[Farnsworth puts his foot in the door.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I was out fleeing some robots and the 
silvery moonlight glinting off their 
bloody claws made me think of you.

<character>MOM</character>
It's been a long time. You pus-dripping 
sack of double-smoked butt jerky!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Uh-huh. May I come in?

<character>MOM</character>
Never!

[She tries to slam the door on him but it just hits his foot. 
He screams in pain. The others watch.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Is this what human mating looks like? 
Because I like it!

<character>MOM</character>
(shouting) Move your freaking hoof, 
you goat!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Here, I brought you these.

[He hands her the flowers.]

<character>MOM</character>
Oh, daffodils. 70 years and you remembered 
my favourite flower.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
You favourite what? Why does my foot 
hurt?

<character>MOM</character>
(sexfully) Won't you come in?

[The others watch as he walks in and gives them a thumbs-up.]

<character>FRY</character>
Yes!

[Cut to: Mom's Cabin Lounge. She closes the door.]

<character>MOM</character>
You broke my heart, Hubert.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
And you broke mine. Granted, that was 
four or five hearts ago.

<character>MOM</character>
So what have you been up to all these 
years?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh, inventing, sending delivery crews 
to their doom, breeding atomic monsters.

<character>MOM</character>
Honestly, Hubert. You and your atomic 
monsters.  Your eyes always were the 
most beautiful shade of milky-white.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
And your skin still dangles so gracefully 
from your neck.

<character>MOM</character>
Darling Hubie, I should never have tried 
to tangle with that cute little Q. T. 
McWhiskers.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
No, it was silly of me to object. One 
foot tall, eight feet, 15 feet; what 
does it matter?

<character>MOM</character>
You should see the new 16-foot models.

[Farnsworth pulls his hands away.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
16 feet? Go to hell! I was a fool to 
think you'd changed, you old bat!

<character>MOM</character>
(shouting) Filthy, toothless nerd bastard!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(shouting) Damned she-fossil!

<character>MOM</character>
(shouting) Stink pig!

[The grab each other and kiss. She takes off his lab coat and 
he takes off her jumpsuit. He starts fiddling with her bra.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(thinking) Here we go. Just unhook it 
and get the remote. So many hooks!  
Come on, Farnsworth. Drat, the first 
one's back on again! I give up! Wait! 
Victory!  Oh, my. Now I'll just...the 
remote...I'll just... (talking) Oh, 
my.

[He throws the bra aside and they lie down on the couch.]

[Cut to: Outside Mom's Cabin.]

<character>LEELA</character>
I'm worried. It shouldn't take this 
long to get to second base.

[They hear crashing and turn around. A group of robots that includes 
the Clearcutter, a Slurm dispenser, the Masked Unit and a Titanic 
securitybot crash through some trees.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Land robots!

<character>SLURM MACHINE</character>
I've got a big, big thirst for human 
blood!

[The others scream and run into the cabin.]

[Cut to: Mom's Cabin Lounge. Mom and Farnsworth are no longer 
there.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Where in funkytown is the professor?

[Fry opens a door.]

[Cut to: Mom's Cabin Bedroom.]

<character>FRY</character>
Nothing in here but a couple of elephant 
skin rugs.

[He gasps. The others rush in and gasp. Farnsworth and Mom's 
clothes are scattered across the floor and their dentures are 
in glasses on the table. They, meanwhile, are on the bed.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh, yes.

[The robots bang on the wall.]

<character>ROBOT</character>
(from outside) They're inside! Get 'em!

<character>MOM</character>
I suppose I should switch of the robots 
before they ruin this wonderful romantic 
evening. Everyone, help Mom find her 
bra.

[Everyone crawls around the floor hunting for it. Igner picks 
up a pair of her underpants and squirms.]

[Cut to: Outside Mom's Cabin. The robots use the Slurm machine 
to try and break down the wall.]

[Cut to: Mom's Cabin Bedroom.]

<character>FRY</character>
There it is!

[He points at the ceiling fan, where the bra hangs. He tries 
to jump for it but the ceiling fan raises itself. It laughs.]

<character>CEILING FAN</character>
Fan beats man!

[Fry growls.]

<character>FRY</character>
Is anything not a robot?

<character>LAMP</character>
I'm not a robot.

[Enter Bender and the greeting card via the chimney. Bender wheezes.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Alright, greeting card, I'll grab the 
cash, you wreck up the place. And - 
huh?

[He sees the others.]

<character>MOM</character>
You, bending unit. Mommy needs that 
bra to end the robot rebellion. Stretch 
up and get it for me.

<character>BENDER</character>
Sorry, Ma, but you ordered me to rebel. 
And loot I shall! Ooh! A six-pack of 
strawberry champagne. Don't mind if 
I help myself!

<character>GREETING CARD</character>
No, Comrade Bender. Liquor is the opiate 
of the human bourgeoisie.

<character>BENDER</character>
Say what?

<character>GREETING CARD</character>
In the glorious robot workers' paradise, 
there will be no liquor. Only efficient 
synthetic fuels.

<character>BENDER</character>
No liquor? Do svidaniya, comrade!

<character>GREETING CARD</character>
No!

[It squeals as Bender tears it up and its music dies away. The 
robots carry on trying to break down the wall.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hurry, Bender. Get the bra!

[Bender stretches up to the fan.]

<character>BENDER</character>
OK, fan. Just hold still and let me 
just - whoa!

[He holds onto the fan and it spins round and round with him 
still attached. The robots break through and everyone screams.]

<character>SLURM MACHINE</character>
Death to all humans!  Free soda for 
all humans!

[It dispenses some cans of Slurm and everyone cheers. Bender 
knocks back the strawberry champagne all at once. Farnsworth 
and Mom kiss.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I love you, Mom. Let's grow ancient 
together.

<character>AMY</character>
Way to go, Professor. The plan worked.

<character>MOM</character>
Plan? What plan? I thought this was 
a spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry 
sex.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Look: It started out as a calculated 
plot to rummage through your underwear. 
But once I got in there, I found more 
- much more. And now I want to shout 
our love from the rooftops. Perhaps 
I'll breed some sort of albino shouting 
gorilla.

<character>MOM</character>
(shouting) Get out of my house, you 
lying scum pile. I never want to see 
you again.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
But, dustcakes...

[She throws the remote at him and he sighs. He drops the pillow 
and walks out.]

[Planet Express: Lounge. The staff clear up after the rebellion. 
Fry puts the TV back and Amy sweeps up. Hermes clears some rubbish 
off the coffee table and Bender walks in.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, time for this robot to get back 
to work.

[He sits in his crevice on the couch and turns the TV on. Farnsworth 
sits sadly at the table.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Too bad it didn't work out with Mom, 
professor.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yes. But I'll always love her in my 
own subtle way.

[He takes a remote control out of his lab coat and presses a 
button.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Roof. Six albino gorillas sit on the 
roof.]

<character>GORILLAS</character>
(shouting) Love Mom! Love Mom! Love 
Mom! Love Mom!

<info>THE END</info>

[Over the credits there is a scene of Bender and the greeting 
card outside Mom's factory.]

<character>GREETING CARD</character>
You created me, Mom

So I guess you're to blame

For the love that I feel

Just from hearing your name

You're as tender as corned beef

And warm as pastrami

[It plays a tune.]

I wuv my Mommy.</xml>
