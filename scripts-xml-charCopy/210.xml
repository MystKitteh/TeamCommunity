[Opening Credits. Caption: Not Based On The Novel by James Fenimore 
Cooper.]

[Planet Express: Lounge. On the TV the heads of George Washington 
and Abraham Lincoln sit on podiums in front of a red curtain.]

<character>LINCOLN</character>
Four score and 1145 years ago our forefather's 
foreheads conceived a new nation.

<character>WASHINGTON</character>
And this Presidents' Day we honoureth 
those values that my body fought and 
died for.

[Behind the heads the curtain opens and reveals a car showroom. 
The salesman, a robot called Malfunctioning Eddie, points to 
a car.]

<character>MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE</character>
Values like this brand new Plymouth 
V'Ger! Hi, I'm Malfunctioning Eddie 
and I'm malfunctioning so badly I'm 
practically giving these cars away!

<character>AMY</character>
Hey, let's go car shopping! My parents 
promised if I got all B's they'd buy 
me a bar. And I got all C's!

<character>BENDER</character>
Mind if I tag along? I gotta bring my 
ass in for servicing.  The recall notice 
says it could burst into flames in a 
low-speed collision.

<character>FRY</character>
No wonder you've been staying at the 
back of conga lines lately.

<character>LEELA</character>
I'll get my coat. Let's go, Bender.

[She taps his ass with a rolled-up newspaper and it bursts into 
flames. Amy, Fry and Leela recoil in horror.]

[Malfunctioning Eddie's Showroom. A man with an accent introduces 
himself to Amy.]

<character>VICTOR</character>
Hello, I am Victor and I know many things 
about the art of unloading fine cars 
on beautiful women.

[He kisses her hand.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Uh-huh. Now tell us she's witty and 
sophisticated.

<character>VICTOR</character>
Ah-ah-ah! A gentleman always sells a 
lady a car first.  This is the Beta 
Romeo. Yes, the Beta Romeo. Note the 
cross-your-heart seat belt which protects, 
lifts and separates.

[At the coffee machine Fry pours himself a cup. A salesman puts 
his hand on his shoulder.]

<character>SALESMAN</character>
Spotted her the minute you walked in, 
didn't you, sir? She's a real beauty.

<character>FRY</character>
Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright.

<character>SALESMAN</character>
No, the Ford Thundercougarfalconbird! 
Nothing makes you feel more like a 
man than a Thundercougarfalconbird. 
So how much were you thinking of spending 
on this Thundercougarfalconbird?

<character>FRY</character>
Sorry, I'm not here to buy.

<character>SALESMAN</character>
I understand and it's wonderful you 
don't care whether anyone questions 
your sexual orientation.

<character>FRY</character>
I care! I care plenty! I just don't 
know how to make them stop!

<character>SALESMAN</character>
One word: Thundercougarfalconbird!

[Amy and Victor are now sat in the Beta Romeo.]

<character>VICTOR</character>
The luxurious seats are stuffed with 
eagle down and the dashboard inlaid 
with the beaks of a thousand eagles. 
Also, there are some eagles under the 
floorboards.

<character>AMY</character>
That's an awful lot of eagle.

<character>VICTOR</character>
Yes, and yet--

[He sighs.]

<character>AMY</character>
What's wrong?

<character>VICTOR</character>
It is just, the luxury edition has so 
much more eagle. It saddens me to think 
of you missing out.

<character>AMY</character>
Oh, don't be sad. My parents are paying 
and they're incredibly rich.

[Victor raises his right eyebrow and pushes it down again with 
his finger.]

[Service Department. Bender is lying down on a raised platform 
and a mechanic drills into his back, causing him pain. The mechanic 
lowers him to the ground and he gets up.]

<character>MECHANIC</character>
I installed shock-absorbing bumpers 
to reduce the risk of catastrophic butt 
failure.

[Bender turns around and gasps at what he sees grafted to his 
butt.]

<character>BENDER</character>
You, sir, have defaced a national treasure! 
I demand you restore my buttocks to 
their former glory.

[He gets back onto the platform.]

<character>MECHANIC</character>
Alright. But sooner or later that ass 
is gonna blow. And when it does, I just 
pray you're not moonin' someone you 
care about.

[Malfunctioning Eddie's Showroom. Amy and Leela look under the 
bonnet of the Beta Romeo's.]

<character>AMY</character>
Smeesh, Leela! This car has everything 
a beautiful woman like me needs. Victor 
said so.

[Victor chuckles.]

<character>VICTOR</character>
(to himself) No dog food for Victor 
tonight.

[Leela closes the bonnet.]

<character>LEELA</character>
OK, the sticker says 55,000 but we'll 
only go as high as say--

[Amy puts her hand in the air.]

<character>AMY</character>
60,000!

[Leela sighs.]

<character>VICTOR</character>
Oh, I will have to ask my manager.

[He walks into Malfunctioning Eddie's office.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Amy, you don't go up from the sticker 
price.

<character>AMY</character>
I thought it was an auction.

[Through the office window, we see Victor say something to Eddie. 
Eddie smiles and they both dance. Victor comes back out again.]

<character>VICTOR</character>
He is not too happy.

<character>AMY</character>
I'm sorry. 80,000?

[Eddie's head explodes.]

[New New York City Street. Amy and the others drive back to the 
Planet Express building. Outside, she prepares to park the car.]

<character>AMY</character>
Uh-oh. I'm terrible at parallel parking.

[The car moves into a space sideways then shunts two cars in 
front and behind it.]

[Planet Express Corridor. Fry and Leela walk past Hermes' office.]

<character>HERMES</character>
(from inside) And now you're asking 
for a day off? Get out of my and my 
sight!  You're bogarting my patience.

[The door opens and Hermes walks out.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Hermes. Who were you yelling at?

<character>HERMES</character>
Myself. I asked myself a Valentine's 
Day off. But I was in no mood for any 
of my shenanigans.

<character>FRY</character>
Valentine's Day's coming? Oh, crap! 
I forgot to get a girlfriend again. 
Well since neither of us has a date, 
why don't we...

<character>LEELA</character>
You just assume I can't get a Valentine's 
date?

<character>FRY</character>
Shall we say 8 o'clock?

[Enter Amy.]

<character>AMY</character>
Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a 
spin to Mercury. Anybody wanna come?

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, <character>OK</character>. What's the weather like?

<character>AMY</character>
The usual: Boiling lead, oceans of lava.

<character>FRY</character>
So, what? Shorts?

[Amy's Car. They drive across the Mercurial surface listening 
to music.]

<character>FRY</character>
Boy, this A.C. is incredible!  I'd better 
turn on the heater too.  (shouting) 
Boy, this heater is incredible! I'd 
better turn up the A.C. some more.

<character>AMY</character>
(shouting) Hey, how about some icy margaritas?

<character>FRY</character>
(shouting) Yeah!  We're slowing down!

<character>AMY</character>
(shouting) Don't worry. I'll hit the 
fuel guzzler!

[She presses a button and the car accelerates.]

<character>FRY</character>
(shouting) Who wants pop-tarts?  Uh-oh!

<character>AMY</character>
It's OK, I have an emergency phone.

[She picks up a make-up case and applies blusher to her cheeks.]

<character>FRY</character>
What are you doing?

<character>AMY</character>
Spluh! It's a video-phone.  Lucky I'm 
a member of the Astro-Afro-Antarctico-Amer-Asian 
Auto Association.  Hello? Septuple-A?

[The sun beats down on the planet. Beads of sweat pour down Fry's 
face. He leans back over the seat and pulls the hood over the 
car.]

<character>FRY</character>
Phew!

[Amy finishes her call and sighs.]

<character>AMY</character>
It'll be a couple hours. Oh, I'm gonna 
get sweat on my sweat-suit.

[She pulls the zip on her top down.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, tell me something: You've got all 
this money, how come you always dress 
like you're doing your laundry?

<character>AMY</character>
I guess 'cause my parents keep telling 
me to be more ladylike.  As though!

<character>FRY</character>
I've been there. My folks were always 
on me to groom myself and wear underpants. 
What am I, the Pope?

[Amy laughs.]

<character>AMY</character>
Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd 
be all, "Straighten your Pope hat," 
and, "Put on your good vestments".  
You know, Fry, its nice to find someone 
I can talk to about stuff, and junk.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, it's like we feel the same way 
about junk and stuff, or, whatever.

[He smiles. She smiles back.]

[Mercury Surface. Later, the sun is setting and the <character>AAAAAAA</character> recovery 
truck arrives. A man gets out and sees the car hood is steamed 
up. He laughs, rubs off the condensation and peers inside. Amy 
and Fry hold a set of cards. The man sighs with disappointment.]

[Cut to: Amy's Car. The recovery truck tows it.]

<character>AMY</character>
So while they're towin' us, you wanna 
do it?

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah.

[They kiss and disappear below the seats. The man laughs again.]

[Planet Express: Meeting Room. The next morning the crew are 
gathered around the table while Hermes presents an important 
chart to them.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Which concludes the summary of the movie 
I saw last night. Now, any old business? 
Any new business?  Anyone spend the 
night together? 

<character>AMY</character>
Yep.

<character>FRY</character>
Kind of.

[Everyone gasps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
What?

<character>HERMES</character>
Oh, my God!

<character>AMY</character>
We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one 
thing led to another.

<character>FRY</character>
And it led there again when we got home.

[He and Amy chuckle.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the 
perfect girlfriend. Amy's rich, she's 
probably got other characteristics.

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender! Romance isn't about money.

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg 
here is desperately poor and miserably 
lonely? Puh-lease!

<character>LEELA</character>
For your information, it's because he's 
hideous.

[Zoidberg sighs.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Well I think Amy and Fry go together 
like a lime and coconut.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Do I hear wedding bells?

<character>FRY</character>
What? No!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Really? Oh, dear.

[He pats the side of his head. Zoidberg sighs.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
You're both very lucky. I'd pay anything 
to end my miserable loneliness. If only 
I weren't so desperately poor.

<character>BENDER</character>
Wait. You mean people will pay good 
money for romance? Hmm. I think I have 
a scheme so deviously clever that I--

[Courtroom. The judge bangs his gavel.]

<character>JUDGE</character>
$500 and time served.

<character>BENDER</character>
Stupid anti-pimping laws.  Well, pay 
the man!

[He struts out. His two Hookerbots follow him.]

<character>HOOKERBOT</character>
Bender, honey, we love you!

<character>BENDER</character>
Shut up, baby, I know it!

[Planet Express Corridor. Bender hammers a sign on a door that 
has "Bender's Computing Dating Service. Discreet And Discrete" 
written on it.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping 
but you rarely have to use the phrase 
"upside your head".

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, this is stupid. Why would anyone 
come to you for romantic help?

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey! Don't make me go upside your head!

[Planet Express: Zoidberg's Office. Zoidberg files his claws 
while Hermes knocks on the supply room door.]

<character>HERMES</character>
(shouting) Fry! Amy! Put your pants 
back on; I need a stapler.

[He struggles to open the locked door. Zoidberg blocks his way.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Stop! Stop! If you interrupt the mating 
dance the male will become enraged and 
maul us with his fearsome gonad.

[Cut to: Planet Express: Supply Room.]

<character>FRY</character>
(whispering) It's working, they think 
we're making out.  Wait, why aren't 
we making out?

<character>AMY</character>
I 'unno.

[They kiss and drop to the floor.]

[Planet Express Corridor. Outside the lounge, Larry, Lou and 
the saleswoman from Alien Overlord &amp; Taylor queue to use Bender's 
dating service.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Bender has set up his dating 
service at the table and is about to interview a client.]

<character>BENDER</character>
OK, Mister...?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Uh, Smith! Zapp Smith. Uh, Brannigan.

<character>BENDER</character>
Just check off the things you're looking 
for in a love partner.

[He hands Zapp a sheet of paper.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
Let's see ... Oh, yes!  Yes, definitely. 
Oh, I'd like some of that.  Mmm, I'll 
just have everything on the menu.

[He punches out the rest of the holes and hands it back to Bender.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Now to run it through our high speed 
romance-a-logical data-fier.  Say hello 
to Miss Right!

<character>ZAPP</character>
(sexfully) Hello!

[He rubs the paper against his chest.]

[Planet Express: Supply Room. Amy and Fry finish making out. 
Fry gasps.]

<character>FRY</character>
Wow! We're great kissers!

<character>AMY</character>
Yeah! Hey, later, you wanna drive out 
to Europa? We could have a picnic and 
spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter.

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back 
in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how 
we sort of think exactly alike, and 
junk.

<character>AMY</character>
Yeah. Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging 
out with you.

[Fry is shocked.]

[Planet Express: Hangar. Leela welds a section of the ships cargo 
lift while Fry paces backwards and forwards.]

<character>FRY</character>
Everything was going great. Then all 
of a sudden, she's talking about hanging 
out. Hangin out? She's getting way too 
serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela.

<character>LEELA</character>
You'll be back to zero soon enough.

<character>FRY</character>
Don't you get it? She's smothering me.

[Amy walks past.]

<character>AMY</character>
Hi.

<character>FRY</character>
You see? You see? Now she's bothering 
me when I'm at work.

<character>LEELA</character>
Fry--!

<character>FRY</character>
I'm doing my job -- there's Amy. I spend 
a few hours selecting a candy from the 
machine -- there's Amy. I wake up the 
morning after sleeping with Amy -- there's 
Amy!

<character>LEELA</character>
I think you're over reacting.

<character>FRY</character>
Am I? (shouting) Am I? (talking) Face 
it, I'm a prize catch.  I mean, I'm 
pulling down delivery boy money.

<character>LEELA</character>
Fry, she's pulling down billionaire 
trust-fund money.

<character>FRY</character>
Then she wants me as a trophy husband. 
Leela, you gotta come to Europa with 
us, I can't be alone with her.

[Amy arrives with a picnic basket.]

<character>AMY</character>
So, ready for a secluded picnic with 
just you and me?

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics 
with just you and me?  Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.

[Zoidberg, scavenging through a dustbin, looks up.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Did someone say something about a free 
hot meal?

[Amy's Car. The car flies past the Monolith from 2001: A Space 
Odyssey and drives across the icy surface of Jupiter's moon while 
Zoidberg eats the contents of the picnic basket.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday! 
Bird eggs, animal slices ...  ... dry 
woven reeds!  All gone! Can I drive?

<character>AMY</character>
No. So, Fry, you busy tomorrow? I got 
two tickets to the big ape fight.

<character>FRY</character>
Jeez, we're already planning to spend 
Valentine's Day together. Isn't that 
enough?

<character>AMY</character>
OK, sure. What do you wanna do for Valentine's 
Day?

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending 
Valentine's Day together?

<character>AMY</character>
But you just said--

<character>FRY</character>
That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, 
you drive.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Wahoo!

[Cut to: Outside Amy's Car. The car tips as they change places.]

<character>FRY</character>
(from inside) Pardon me, excuse me.

[Cut to: Amy's Car. Zoidberg is at the wheel while Fry and Amy 
are in the back.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum 
fastness!

[He turns it. Amy screams.]

<character>FRY</character>
Amy, you know how at first you like 
chocolate but then you start to get 
tired of it because it always wants 
to hang out with you?

<character>AMY</character>
Huh? You don't like chocolate?

<character>FRY</character>
Look, could chocolate just let me finish?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Vroom vroom! And the winner of the big 
car race is: Hot Rod Zoidberg!

[He mimes a crowd cheering.]

<character>FRY</character>
Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think 
maybe you and I should stop--

[Something in the front snaps. Zoidberg has pulled the wheel 
off.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Uh-oh. Here, you drive!

[He offers the wheel to Fry. The car spins out of control, hitting 
chunks of ice. It heads straight for a huge mountain of ice. 
Fry screams and the car crashes.]

[Europa Surface. Fry was out cold but comes to. Zoidberg looks 
over him.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Fry? Are you alright?

<character>FRY</character>
Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? 
Was anybody hurt?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
No, no, no, no, no, of course not. Nobody 
but you. I'm afraid your body was badly 
damaged in the crash.

<character>FRY</character>
How badly?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
That's it over there.  Don't worry, 
I managed to keep your head alive with 
some quick surgery.

[Fry moves his eyes up and down.]

<character>FRY</character>
Where is it?

[Zoidberg points.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
There.

[Fry turns to his right and sees Amy's head. Zoidberg has grafted 
his head onto her left shoulder.]

<character>AMY</character>
Looks like we'll be spending a lot more 
time together, Fry!

[Fry screams.]

[Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Farnsworth and Zoidberg inspect 
Fry's body. Leela tuts.]

<character>LEELA</character>
This sort of thing always happens with 
office romances.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body 
all fixed up in a few days.  Upsy daisy!

[He walks out of the room, hitting the body on the walls on the 
way out. Fry whimpers.]

<character>FRY</character>
Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere 
with your life too much.

[Amy seems to pick her nose.]

<character>AMY</character>
Fry!

<character>FRY</character>
Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm.

[He waves the arm around and hoots.]

<character>AMY</character>
So, what was it you wanted to talk about 
before we crashed anyway?

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, that.  Maybe we'd better talk in 
private. (whispering) I'll meet you 
in the closet.

[Planet Express: Supply Room.]

<character>FRY</character>
Amy, I really like you, as a friend. 
But I think we're spending too much 
time together.

<character>AMY</character>
You're breaking up with me?

<character>FRY</character>
I just think we should start seeing 
other people.

<character>AMY</character>
But, I was really having fun.  If that's 
how you feel.

<character>FRY</character>
I'm sorry, but it is.

<character>AMY</character>
Well, whatever. Hey, listen, as long 
as we're not seeing each other, you 
mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's 
Day?

<character>FRY</character>
Huh?

<character>AMY</character>
I mean, unless it would make you feel 
bad, being a third wheel.

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, I can get a date too. Now that 
I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of 
women!

<character>AMY</character>
With my body I think you might only 
attract one sort of woman.

<character>FRY</character>
(happy) Oh! (disappointed) Oh!

[Planet Express: Lounge. Bender drinks from a bottle. Leela sits 
down and plays with his "Dating Consultant" nameplate nonchalantly.]

<character>LEELA</character>
So, how's business?

[Bender opens his chest cabinet, revealing a huge pile of money. 
He pulls out a $500 note.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore? 
I'm tellin' ya, losers get really desperate 
around Valentine's Day.

<character>LEELA</character>
Yeah, it's pathetic alright!  How much?

<character>BENDER</character>
500 bucks.

<character>LEELA</character>
Done.

<character>BENDER</character>
Zapp Brannigan OK?

<character>LEELA</character>
No!

<character>BENDER</character>
600.

[Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. Enter Leela who sees Fry and 
Amy playing table tennis. Fry sees Leela.]

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you 
for a minute?  In private?

<character>AMY</character>
Oh, no problem.

[She puts her fingers in her ears and sings to herself in Chinese.]

<character>FRY</character>
This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's 
plans with some goon and I'm gonna be 
stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will 
you be my date, please?

<character>LEELA</character>
You're too late, Fry. I'm sharing Valentine's 
Day with a very special man. He's not 
Zapp Brannigan or anything!

<character>FRY</character>
Then I have no choice but to do something 
so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm 
ashamed to tell you about it.

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender's in his office.

<character>FRY</character>
Thanks.

[Planet Express: Lounge. Amy is still singing while Fry does 
business with Bender.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I got your hook-up, Fry. Now my usual 
fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's 
you, I'll need it in advance.

[Amy's Apartment. Amy dresses herself while Fry "helps".]

<character>AMY</character>
OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra.

<character>FRY</character>
Why exactly did you shave your legs 
anyway? Are you expecting something 
to happen with your Valentine's date?

<character>AMY</character>
What business is it of yours?

<character>FRY</character>
And another thing: You're using an awful 
lot of make-up there.

<character>AMY</character>
This is deodorant.

<character>FRY</character>
What does it do?

[The doorbell rings. Amy reaches for her dress.]

<character>AMY</character>
(shouting) C'mon in, Gary! I'll just 
be another 20 minutes.

<character>GARY</character>
(from outside) I'll be waiting.

<character>FRY</character>
20 minutes? You're practically ready 
now!

<character>AMY</character>
Yeah, but it's good to make them wait 
a little.

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, God, it's true!

[Elzar's Fine Cuisine. Amy, Gary and Fry sit at a table. Fry 
eats a hamburger.]

<character>GARY</character>
That dress looks great on you.

<character>AMY</character>
(simultaneously) Thanks.

<character>FRY</character>
(simultaneously) Thanks.  Where is she?

<character>GARY</character>
I must say, Amy, you're all made up, 
just like Fry's date. Get it?

[Amy shakes her head.]

<character>AMY</character>
Mm-mm.

<character>FRY</character>
I've got a date. She'll be along any 
minute.

[Enter Bender with a old woman.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Fry, look who I found! It's Petunia, 
your dream girl!

<character>PETUNIA</character>
How's them eats?

<character>FRY</character>
Uh--

<character>PETUNIA</character>
Don't mind if I do.  Kids'll be hungry.

<character>FRY</character>
(whispering) She seems a little old 
for me.

<character>BENDER</character>
She is well-travelled. And I don't mean 
she travels a lot!

<character>PETUNIA</character>
Wheels fell off my house.

<character>BENDER</character>
Now how about a rose for the lady? Five 
bucks a pop!

<character>GARY</character>
I'll take one.

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.

<character>BENDER</character>
Eight bucks.

<character>FRY</character>
But you just said--

<character>BENDER</character>
Demand suddenly skyrocketed, you all 
saw it.

[On another table, Leela sits alone. She sighs. Bender arrives.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Leela, meets your future husband Sal.

[Sal is wearing blue overalls and has a cigarette in his mouth. 
He cringes.]

<character>SAL</character>
Nice eyeball, eyeball.

<character>LEELA</character>
Nice ass, ass.

<character>BENDER</character>
Ooh, sparks! (whispering) Buy her a 
rose, I guarantee she'll put out!

[Sal considers then sits down.]

<character>SAL</character>
Eh, I'll take my chances.

[Time Lapse. Bender's other clients are also there. Larry eats 
from Hattie's fork and Zapp makes a toast with his woman who 
has a five-o'clock shadow.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
Cheers!

<title>WOMAN</title>
Cheers!

[Fry and Petunia don't seem to be gelling.]

<character>PETUNIA</character>
So tell me about your prospects. You 
a good gambler?

<character>FRY</character>
Well, ma'am I--

<character>PETUNIA</character>
What's your game? Bingo? Keno? Wait 
a minute! You don't have your own body.

<character>FRY</character>
No, but I control this arm.

<character>PETUNIA</character>
Slots player, huh? Sorry, but I think 
I can do better.

[She gets up from the table.]

<character>FRY</character>
Wait, come back, uh, darling.

<character>PETUNIA</character>
Can't, hon. I gotta catch my bus back 
to Nutley. I'd kiss you goodnight but 
I lost my teeth pulling out a stump.

[She walks towards the exit.]

<character>SAL</character>
So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take 
a whack at ya but that 10:15 to Nutley 
ain't goin' nowheres without yours truly 
behinds the wheel.

<character>PETUNIA</character>
Excuse me, did you say "10:15 to Nutley"?

<character>SAL</character>
Why, yes I dids.

[They stare into each others eyes and passionately kiss. Leela 
turns to Bender.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(whispering) Bender! Did you just round 
up our dates at the bus station?

<character>BENDER</character>
Of course not.

<character>SAL</character>
Anybodys else for Nutley?

[Bender's customers get up and head for the door. Zapp's date 
also leaves.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
Baby, wait! You didn't show me your 
surprise.

[Gary has his arm around Amy.]

<character>GARY</character>
(whispering) You know what I'd like 
to do...?

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, jeez, get a room!

<character>GARY</character>
Maybe later.

[Fry is shocked.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out 
for ice cream.

<character>GARY</character>
Actually, I thought Amy might like to 
come back to my place for coffee.

<character>AMY</character>
I don't really like coffee.

<character>GARY</character>
Neither do I.

[Fry is shocked again.]

<character>AMY</character>
Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!

[Fry is shocked again.]

<character>GARY</character>
Let me pick up the check.

<character>FRY</character>
Nooo!  That's it I'm gettin' the hell 
outta here.  Ooh! Ow!

[Leela hears Fry and walks to their table just as Amy and Gary 
are about to leave.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Why, if it isn't my favourite head on 
Amy's body: Fry.

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, Leela!

<character>AMY</character>
We were just on our way out.

<character>LEELA</character>
Nonsense, the evening's young. So, Gary, 
what do you do for a living?

<character>GARY</character>
I'm a banking industry regulator.

[Amy sighs.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Really? Y'know I heard that banking 
industry regulations are really very 
simple.

<character>GARY</character>
Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern 
banking regulations are a product of 
five different regulatory traditions. 
Six if you wanna get technical.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, I do.

<character>GARY</character>
It all began in 1410 when a number of 
noblemen convened...

[Fry and Leela look at each other.]

<character>FRY </character>(<character>WHISPERING</character>)
Thank you.

[They smile.]

[Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Zoidberg finishes stitching 
Fry's head to his neck.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
There you are, good as new. Except for 
your dorsal fin, I'm afraid I couldn't 
find it after the crash.

<character>FRY</character>
Can I live without it?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
If you call that living.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I still don't understand why you wouldn't 
let me graft a laser cannon onto your 
chest. To crush those who disobey you. 
But I guess we're just two different 
people.

[He and Zoidberg leave.]

<character>FRY</character>
So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And 
I hope there are no hard feelings about 
your date, or stuff.

<character>AMY</character>
It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel 
lonely I can just look over at this 
disfiguring scar and think of you.

[They smile. Amy leaves. Fry sighs.]

<character>FRY</character>
Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own 
body back.

[He yawns, stretches and pats his chest. He looks down and sighs. 
Enter Leela and Bender.]

<character>LEELA</character>
So how's the old corpse? Everything 
hooked up OK?

[Fry stands up.]

<character>FRY</character>
Seems to be. My neck's just a little 
tender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. 
Thanks for rescuing me last night.

<character>LEELA</character>
Anytime. I actually enjoyed hanging 
out with you.

[Enter Bender, counting his profits.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Yep, everything worked out great thanks 
to good old Bender.

<character>LEELA</character>
Come on! It's not like you intentionally 
set us up with bad dates so we'd spend 
Valentine's Day together.

<character>BENDER</character>
Didn't I, Leela? Didn't I?

[He winks and a heart wipe closes the scene but opens up again.]

<character>LEELA</character>
No! You didn't! You just corralled a 
bunch of stiffs at the bus station and 
pocketed our money!

<character>BENDER</character>
True. But in the end, isn't that what 
Valentine's Day is really all about?

<character>LEELA</character>
Yeah.

<character>FRY</character>
I guess so.  Watch the neck! Watch the 
neck!

[He kicks Bender's ass and sparks start coming out of it.]

<character>BENDER</character>
My ass! My beautiful ass!

[It explodes.]
