Song.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. On the TV, Morbo and Linda present an 
early morning breakfast programme called Good Morning Earth. 
They are wearing pyjamas and sit in a cosy sitting room set.</info>

<character>MORBO</character>
...So I gave the cookies to Fawn and 
the kids and they couldn't believe it 
-- they were delicious. But, I digress. 
(shouting) Tremble, puny earthlings! 
One day my race will destroy you all!

<info>Leela, Fry and Bender eat while they watch. The doorbell rings.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Could one of you guys get that?

<info>They both shake their heads she narrows her eye at them.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Entrance Foyer. Leela opens the door and looks 
around but there doesn't appear to be anyone there. She hears 
a squealing noise, looks down and gasps.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Planet Express.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
It's a doorbell baby!  Hello, little 
guy. You know, I was abandoned as a 
baby too, so --

<character>BENDER</character>
Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it.

<info>He starts stamping on the basket.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, stop! It's a baby!

<character>BENDER</character>
A baby what?  Ow!

<info>Leela bends down and unwraps the blankets. There is no baby 
inside. Instead, there is a green card with a sad looking kid 
on it holding up an empty food dish. Written along the top of 
the card is "Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanariumï¿½.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, it's just a card -- from the orphanarium 
I grew up in.

<info>The card speaks with a child's voice.</info>

<character>CARD</character>
Leela, you're invited to reunion at 
Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium. 
Please stand clear of self-destructing 
basket.

<info>The basket explodes.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? 
You gonna go?

<character>LEELA</character>
No way, jose-bot. I never wanna see 
those other orphans again! Not after 
the way they used to pick on me.

<info>Flashback: In the kids' playground at the orphanarium (where 
everything is broken) the kids stand around young Leela, pointing 
and chanting.</info>

<character>KIDS</character>
(chanting) One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!

<character>KIRK</character>
Nice depth-perception, one-eye!

<info>He laughs.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're 
blind!

<character>KIRK</character>
My eyes may not work, but at least I 
got two of them!

<info>He laughs again. Leela sighs.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine 
the look on their faces when you show 
up with two friends who eat all the 
hors d'oeuvres.

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success 
in a few choice faces.

<character>BENDER</character>
Set a course for adventure!

<info>Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium Lobby. There a broken, 
leaking pipes running across the ceiling, the windows are barred 
up and owls scavenge around the floor. Leela is wearing a purple 
suit.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Eww!

<character>BENDER</character>
What a dump!

<info>Leela sighs.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Just like old times. Gosh. The bars 
on the windows seemed so much thicker 
back then.  Mr. Vogel? Remember me?

<character>VOGEL</character>
Leela! You're worthless and no one will 
ever love you!

<info>They both laugh.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
You used to say that all the time!

<character>VOGEL</character>
Oh, those were happier days.

<info>Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium Gymnasium. A "Welcome, 
Orphans" banner has been strung up across the ceiling and the 
room has been decorated with balloons and streamers. There is 
a sign that says "Please Abandon Coats In Lobby" next to the 
buffet table where Fry and Bender stand.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't 
half bad.

<character>BENDER</character>
Mmm! And try one of these Popsicle sticks. 
They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.

<character>LEELA</character>
Hey, look. It's our old group picture.

<info>They look at a black and white photo of the orphans and a younger 
Vogel. Fry squints.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I don't see you anywhere.

<character>LEELA</character>
That's me over in Cootietown.

<info>She points at herself, standing apart from the group. Bender 
points at someone in the back row.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking 
guy!

<character>LEELA</character>
That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have 
kind of a crush on him.

<info>Flashback. The scene continues from earlier with the kids still 
chanting.</info>

<character>KIDS</character>
(chanting) One-eye! One-eye!

<character>FRENCH GUY</character>
Stupid as a French guy!

<character>KIDS</character>
(chanting) One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! 
One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! 
One-eye!

<info>Adlai chants with the others and Leela looks at him with lovey 
eyes and sighs.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, it's time to say hello to the 
old gang.

<info>She gulps down her drink, then Bender's and then the water from 
a vase of flowers. On the other side of the gym, the orphans 
have turned into bums.</info>

<character>MAN #1</character>
So, watcha been up to since you left 
the orphanarium?

<character>MAN #2</character>
Uh, living in a box, fighting the shakes. 
You?

<character>MAN #1</character>
Selling kidneys, teeth; whatever falls 
out of me.

<character>LEELA</character>
And what am I up to, you ask? Well I'm 
a very successful space captain.

<character>MAN #2</character>
Oh.

<character>MAN #1</character>
Wow.

<character>MAN #3</character>
How nice for you, Leela.

<character>WOMAN</character>
(patronising) That's so good for a person 
with one eye.

<character>LEELA</character>
Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm 
a space captain and you're all a bunch 
of losers.

<character>MAN #1</character>
Uh, right, right. We're the losers!

<info>He coughs and a tooth falls out of his mouth. Kirk arrives.</info>

<character>KIRK</character>
Well, if it isn't old one-eye!

<info>He laughs.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!

<character>MAN #3</character>
He can't hear you. He's deaf now.

<character>ADLAI</character>
Leave Leela alone. She's leading a perfectly 
normal life. She's not gussied up, duded 
out, getting down or where it's at. 
Now, run along.

<info>The other five leave.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really 
outgrow being an eyeball -- oddball!

<character>ADLAI</character>
Nonsense. You're a space captain. That's 
a fine, conventional profession.

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, you know. It's just for a package 
delivery service.

<character>ADLAI</character>
Ah-ah. A package is just a box until 
it's delivered.

<character>LEELA</character>
Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. 
So what do you do these days?

<character>ADLAI</character>
Oh, I'm a doctor.

<character>LEELA</character>
A tall doctor, you say?

<info>She brushes her fingers through her hair. At the bar, Bender 
drinks down one glass while another is being refilled. Vogel 
stands behind Fry with 12 kids.</info>

<character>VOGEL</character>
Sir, you seem pretty stable. Have you 
thought about adopting one of our kids?

<character>FRY</character>
Sure haven't.

<character>VOGEL</character>
Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great 
way to have kids without having sex.

<character>FRY</character>
(thoughtful) Really?

<character>VOGEL</character>
Plus, the government will help out with 
a small stipend of $100 a week.

<character>BENDER</character>
$100 a week?

<info>He spits out his drink, has it refilled, drinks it and spits 
it out again. Aldai and Leela look at the group photos.</info>

<character>ADLAI</character>
I'm so sorry I teased you back then. 
Let me make it up to you. I can fix 
it so that no one ever makes fun of 
you again.

<character>LEELA</character>
You mean by beating them up? Because 
I've broken that blind kid's nose like 
10 times and it doesn't make any difference.

<character>ADLAI</character>
No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. 
I can build you a paraffin eye and graft 
it on with skin from your foot. It won't 
be able to see but you'll look like 
a perfectly normal two-eyed person.

<character>LEELA</character>
Me? Perfectly normal?

<info>She touches her eye and it squelches. Fry eats more of the hors 
d'oeuvres and turns around when he hears laughing kids. Bender 
is with the kids.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, why are those kids following you? 
Do you have candy stuck to your ass?

<character>BENDER</character>
No. It's called parenting. Come on, 
dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends 
to collect.

<character>KIDS</character>
(cheering) Yay!

<character>BOY</character>
Our daddy's a giant toy!

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The staff sit around the conference 
table.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. 
I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping 
at her eye all the time.

<info>He stares open-mouthed at her.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. 
I used to be too cute, so I had cuteness-reduction 
surgery here......and here.

<info>She points to her nose.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need 
surgery. You look great the way you 
are.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once 
in my life, I just wanna look normal.

<character>FRY</character>
But you're better than normal, you're 
abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't 
care what other people think.

<character>LEELA</character>
You're right! I'll start by not caring 
what you think!  I'm getting the surgery.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Thatagirl!

<character>AMY</character>
Right on!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Wonderful. And while you're under the 
knife, you could also get an ink pouch 
to help you escape your enemies.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
That's the stupidest idea I've ever 
heard you imbecile!

<info>He raises a rolled-up newspaper at Zoidberg. Zoidberg sprays 
ink at his face and runs off, whooping.</info>

<info>Taco Bellevue Hospital. There is a sign outside that says "Normal, 
Healthy Baby? Super-Size It For 49c!" Inside, the Planet Express 
staff and Adlai stand around Leela's bed. The entire top half 
of Leela head is covered with bandages.</info>

<character>ADLAI</character>
Now we'll find out if the operation 
was a success. Hold on to your hats. 
Oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong patient. 
Oops.

<info>He scribbles on a new pupil with a marker pen.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Leela, those eyes look so great on you.

<character>FRY</character>
Bah! I think she looked fine before.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
No.

<character>AMY</character>
Uh-uh.

<character>HERMES</character>
Wrong.

<info>Leela looks at herself in a mirror.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Wow, look at me. Although I don't have 
the hang of blinking yet.

<character>ADLAI</character>
You'll get it. Personally, I try not 
to blink too much because it seems flashy. 
But when I do, I enjoy it.

<info>She tries again and succeeds this time. She gasps.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
I did it! I blunk!

<character>HERMES</character>
And just in time to screw up this picture 
I took!

<info>He shows her a photo of her blinking.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Hooray!

<info>Montage Scene. Leela gets accustomed to her new life to Roy 
Orbison's Pretty Woman. She carries a box marked "Leela's Monocles" 
through the front door of her apartment building at drops it 
in the bin. Later, she comes out of the Eye Robot wearing two 
pairs of sunglasses, a pair of binoculars and carrying a pair 
of theatre specs. She walks past Mom's sons and winks at them. 
They stop and bump into each other.</info>

<character>WALT</character>
Ow!

<character>IGNER</character>
Ow!

<character>LARRY</character>
Ow!

<info>Amy shows Leela how to apply eyeliner. She puts it across her 
eyes first and watches Leela try. Leela smears it all the way 
across her brow. Amy shakes her head, licks her finger, and rubs 
it off in the middle. Leela smiles. On the street, Leela bumps 
into Kirk. She takes his hand and feels her face with it. He 
groans with disappointment.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Zoidberg, Hermes, Amy and Fry are sat 
on the couch.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
I've never felt so unremarkable! Today 
I actually blended in with a crowd!

<info>She laughs. Bender walks in with the kids.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with.

<character>KIDS</character>
(chanting) Hello, jerkbags!

<character>AMY</character>
Oh, they're so cute! What are their 
names?

<character>BENDER</character>
Kids have names?

<character>NINA</character>
My name's Nina, and his name's Albert 
--

<character>BENDER</character>
And from now on, you're all named Bender 
Jr.!  Looky here! My first government 
stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 
wing-wangs!

<info>Sally, a girl with an ear on her face, tugs Bender's arm.</info>

<character>SALLY</character>
Daddy Bender, we're hungry.

<character>BENDER</character>
What is it with you kids? Every other 
day, it's food, food, food!  Oh, fine. 
I'll get you some stupid food.

<character>ALBERT</character>
Can we have Bender burgers again?

<character>BENDER</character>
No. The cat shelter's on to me!

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. Fry scrubs one of the landing feet and 
Leela welds something along the ships side. Adlai comes in wearing 
a grey Hawaiian shirt.</info>

<character>ADLAI</character>
Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor 
getting one of my Hawaiian shirts toned 
down, so I thought I'd drop in for your 
follow-up exam.

<info>Leela giggles.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
That's so handsome of you.

<character>ADLAI</character>
Just follow the light with your eyes. 
Perfect! You know, a guy could fall 
head-over-heels for a gal like you. 
As for me, I'm somewhat interested 
myself.

<character>LEELA</character>
What are you saying?

<character>ADLAI</character>
I've never been good with words, which 
is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum. 
Will you go out with me this Sunday?

<character>LEELA</character>
Sure!

<info>Fry gasps.</info>

<character>ADLAI</character>
I don't know what else to say, so I'll 
just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then.

<info>He leaves.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
This is so unfair! I liked you back 
when you were a cyclops! That guy's 
only interested now that you have two 
eyes.

<character>LEELA</character>
You're just jealous!

<character>FRY</character>
No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my 
point remains valid!

<character>LEELA</character>
Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal 
man, who if you go somewhere with him 
no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve 
that once in life.

<info>Zoidberg holds her arm.</info>

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Be careful with Adlai, Leela, he's a 
doctor, they're very poor.

<character>LEELA</character>
Actually, most doctors are rich.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
What? When did this happen? You're joking, 
right?  That's not funny!

<info>O'Zorgnax's Pub. Bender takes the kids in.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
OK, they've got everything you need 
here: Booze, a couple of peanuts, they 
got a crapper in the back -- that's 
one of the things you kids do, right?

<character>ALBERT</character>
Yeah.

<character>BENDER</character>
Then knock yourself out.  Hey! Hey! 
Only eat enough to barely keep yourselves 
alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.

<info>He sits on a stool and reads a newspaper.</info>

<character>NINA</character>
Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!

<character>BENDER</character>
Here.

<info>He hands her a blernsball bat and she runs off with it, laughing. 
A fembot sits next to Bender.</info>

<character>FEMBOT</character>
These kids yours?

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah.

<character>FEMBOT</character>
Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!

<character>BENDER</character>
That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the 
kids in an alley and we can go have 
some fun.

<info>A boy taps Bender.</info>

<character>BOY</character>
Daddy Bender?

<character>BENDER</character>
Son, daddy's trying to score with a 
cheap floozy right now, so we need you 
to cram a Tinkertoy in it!

<character>BOY</character>
I love you, Daddy Bender!

<info>He hugs him. The other kids start hugging him too.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit 
hugging me!

<character>FEMBOT</character>
I guess you're busy. I'll catch you 
later.

<info>She leaves.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
You morons! I don't know what you're 
trying to pull here but I got half a 
mind to hug each and every one of you 
and see how you like it!

<character>KIDS</character>
(cheering) Yay!

<character>BENDER</character>
(grumbling) Oh, come on!

<info>Adlai's Car. He drives Leela away from the city.</info>

<character>ADLAI</character>
I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary 
-- a place no one could object to.

<character>LEELA</character>
That sounds wonderful.

<info>Outside Municipal Arboretum. Adlai opens the gate and lets Leela 
through. On the fence is a sign that reads "Yes, We Have Looking 
At Trees".</info>

<info>Municipal Arboretum. A couple stop by an Altairean Bouquet Tree.</info>

<character>MAN</character>
I'd like and extra-beautiful bouquet 
for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.

<info>The tree hands the man some flowers and he hands them to the 
woman. They walk away and Leela and Adlai arrive.</info>

<character>ADLAI</character>
Average, please.

<info>The tree hands him a bunch and he hands them to Leela. She smells 
them.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time 
today. No one's stared at me or avoided 
staring at me or tried to burn me. You 
make me feel so not weird.

<character>ADLAI</character>
Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!

<info>She smiles and they lean in to kiss. Adlai pecks her on the 
lips and she freezes for a moment then smiles weakly.</info>

<info>Elzar's Fine Cuisine. Adlai and the Planet Express staff sit 
around a table, though Bender is not with them.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Thanks for coming out to get to know 
my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(mesmerised) Totally.

<info>He eats a cracker.</info>

<character>ADLAI</character>
Uh, listen: I just want you all to know 
your Leela's one standard lady.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, Adlai, stop!

<character>FRY</character>
What's so wonderful about Leela being 
normal? The rest of us aren't normal 
and that's what makes us great. Like 
Dr. Zoidberg: He's a weird monster who 
smells like he eats garbage and does.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Damn right!

<character>FRY</character>
And the professor's a senile, amoral 
crackpot.  Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.

<character>HERMES</character>
Tally me banana.

<character>FRY</character>
Amy's a klutz from Mars.

<info>Amy drops the glass she is drinking from and it smashes.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Sploops!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
And Fry, you've got that brain thing.

<character>FRY</character>
I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna 
be like us? Or do you wanna be like 
Adlai with no severe mental or social 
problems whatsoever?

<character>LEELA</character>
That's the dumbest question I ever heard!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
She's right!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
No doubt about it.

<character>AMY</character>
Duh!

<character>HERMES</character>
Daylight come!

<info>Bender runs through the restaurant carrying a high chair.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Coming through, watch your heads!

<info>He wangs Zoidberg on the head as he passes him.</info>

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Help! I'm under attack!

<info>He sprays the others with ink. Bender is sat with the kids at 
another table.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Remember your manners, kids. Forks go 
in the left pocket, spoons in the right.

<info>Elzar arrives with a plate of food.</info>

<character>ELZAR</character>
Which one of you cutie muffins gets 
the children's spicy squab?

<info>A little boy comes out of Bender's chest door.</info>

<character>LITTLE BOY</character>
Me!

<character>BENDER</character>
Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone 
gives you something?

<info>The boy turns to Elzar.</info>

<character>LITTLE BOY</character>
'Bout time!

<character>BENDER</character>
That's my boy!

<info>He closes the door on him.</info>

<character>ELZAR</character>
And here's your check. Bam!

<info>Bender looks at it and gasps. Albert taps his arm.</info>

<character>ALBERT</character>
I gotta go poopy!

<character>BENDER</character>
Well you should've gone poopy before 
it was time to run out on the check! 
C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!

<info>They leg it.</info>

<character>ELZAR</character>
(shouting) You little crooks! If I catch 
you I'm going to make cutie-muffin gumbo!

<info>They run past the other table and Bender laughs as they run 
through the door.</info>

<character>ADLAI</character>
You know, seeing that strange robot 
force 12 children to do his bidding 
makes me think about kids of our own.

<character>LEELA</character>
Us? Me? You? Kids?

<character>ADLAI</character>
That's correct. It's time to stop living 
this vida bachelor loca, settle down 
and have kids.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful 
moment of my life!

<info>Zoidberg woops and sprays her with ink.</info>

<info>Fry and Bender's Spare Room. The room has six bunk beds in it. 
The kids run around screaming and laughing and bouncing on the 
mattresses. Fry and Bender play poker. Albert jumps on Bender.</info>

<character>ALBERT</character>
Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride.

<character>BENDER</character>
Daddy's tired. Let's just have another 
dog pile on Fry.

<info>The kids dive on Fry.</info>

<character>SALLY</character>
Tell us a story, Daddy Bender.

<character>KIDS</character>
(chanting) Story! Story! Story!

<character>BENDER</character>
Alright, fine, gather round.

<info>The kids cheer.</info>

<character>NINA</character>
We wanna hear this one again!

<info>She hands him something and he opens it and clears his throat.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(reading) "Bender's Arrest Record" by 
the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender 
was caught shoplifting!

<character>ALBERT</character>
Yeah, show us the picture!  There he 
is!

<character>BENDER</character>
OK, kids. It's 9:00, you know what that 
means. Daddy's sick of looking at you 
so go to bed.  The grown-ups have to 
talk. Come on, Ma.

<info>He and Fry leave.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry and Bender's Lounge. On the door is a newspaper 
clipping with a photo of Fry on it. The headline reads "Primitive 
Human Found In Cryo-Tube". Bender slides the door shut.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Now to figure out how much money I'm 
raking in off those twerps!  Oh, I need 
a calculator.

<character>FRY</character>
You are a calculator.

<character>BENDER</character>
I mean a good calculator. Minus the 
food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper -- 
I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're 
costing 110!

<info>Fry tuts.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
There goes my new kitchen cabinets.

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm not sitting through one more <character>PTA </character>
meeting. The kids have got to go!

<info>The little boys opens Bender's door.</info>

<character>LITTLE BOY</character>
Daddy, how do I flush you?

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Just go to bed!

<info>The boy climbs out and runs off. Bender pushes his antenna down 
and flushes himself.</info>

<info>Adlai's Lounge. He and Leela sit at a table doing a jigsaw.</info>

<character>ADLAI</character>
You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of 
a pacifier factory makes me want to 
have children with you all the more.

<character>LEELA</character>
Adlai, I was thinking. Since we're both 
orphans, maybe we should adopt a child.

<character>ADLAI</character>
Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, 
it's more than acceptable. It's adequately 
satisfactory!

<info>Robot Arms Apartments Corridor. Adlai opens Fry and Bender's 
door and he and Leela go in. There is a sign above the door that 
says "Honest Bender's Stolen Car Parts Boutique" and scribbled 
below it "And Orphanarium".</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry and Bender's Lounge. The kids are up again and running 
around. Bender is on the phone.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've 
got a herd of you-know-whats for sale...Let 
me check.  Oh, aren't you a cutie?  
About 35lbs.  What?!

<info>Fry points and Bender panics and hangs up.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child.

<info>Bender stands up.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, you've come to the right place 
because Honest Bender's Orphanarium 
means discount orphans. Now, little 
lady. What do I have to do to send you 
home with 12 orphans today?

<character>ADLAI</character>
Uh, I'm afraid we only want one.

<character>BENDER</character>
Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you 
what I got in stock.

<info>He walks into the kids' room.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
I remember this from when we were kids: 
The warden would trot you out in front 
of prospective parents and they'd judge 
you like a piece of meat.

<info>The kids are lined up. Albert steps forward.</info>

<character>ALBERT</character>
I'm Albert.

<character>LEELA</character>
Kind of fatty.

<info>Bender pushes Nina forward.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Then how about this little number? Pure-bred 
human. No vampire in there.

<character>LEELA</character>
Uh, um.

<character>ADLAI</character>
Hmm.

<character>BENDER</character>
If you're strapped for cash, you might 
wanna consider this irregular unit. 
Cursed with a third ear but so full 
of that emotion that I understand is 
called "love".

<character>SALLY</character>
One time, I did a hundred jump ropes.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have 
to think about it.

<character>BENDER</character>
OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk, time 
for bed.

<character>ALBERT</character>
But it's 10 in the morning!

<character>BENDER</character>
I said hit the hay!

<info>The kids run.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry and Bender's Spare Room. The kids get into bed and 
Bender flicks the light off.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, they're all so adorable.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah. You know, it's times like this 
I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, 
you princes of Maine, you kings of New 
New England.

<info>Fry and Bender's Lounge. The police break down the door.</info>

<character>SMITTY</character>
You're under arrest for child cruelty, 
child endangerment, depriving children 
of food, selling children as food and 
misrepresenting the weight of livestock.

<info>Time Lapse. Smitty slaps the cuffs on Bender and the other police 
lead Fry and the kids out.</info>

<info>Prison Cells. Smitty locks Fry, Bender and the kids in a cell.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Officer, would it be alright if we adopted 
one of the kids?

<character>SMITTY</character>
Might as well. They're just gonna rot 
in the evidence locker.

<info>He and <character>URL</character> leave. The kids laugh and point at Sally.</info>

<character>KID #1</character>
Nice ear!

<character>KID #2</character>
Hey, freaky ears!

<character>KID #3</character>
How's you ear?

<character>LEELA</character>
I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.

<info>She points at Sally.</info>

<character>ADLAI</character>
Her? But there's plenty of normal ones.

<character>LEELA</character>
Come on, Adlai. She could really use 
a mom and dad.

<character>KIDS</character>
(chanting) Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally 
won the ugly race!

<character>ADLAI</character>
On the other hand, the children bring 
up a good point. She does have an ear 
on her face.

<character>LEELA</character>
Well? So what? She may be different 
but she still deserves a good home.

<character>ADLAI</character>
Oh, alright. If you really want that 
one, I can give her an operation to 
make her acceptable.

<character>LEELA</character>
She doesn't need an operation! She's 
fine the way she is!

<character>ADLAI</character>
Oh, and I suppose you were fine the 
way you were?

<character>LEELA</character>
Damn right I was!

<character>FRY</character>
Yay!

<character>LEELA</character>
Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud 
to be different. And I just wished I'd 
realised that when I was her age.

<character>SALLY</character>
I also have a tail!

<character>LEELA</character>
Now take me to the hospital and put 
my eye back the way it was. Right now!

<character>ADLAI</character>
Why should I do that?

<info>Leela slams him against the bars.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, 
one of us is going to have one eye.

<info>Outside Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium. People are 
crowded around the front door as Vogel makes a speech.</info>

<character>VOGEL</character>
In recognition of Bender's generous 
gift of 12 orphans and a government 
cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby 
rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez 
Orphanarium!

<info>The crowd cheers and Vogel shakes Bender's hand. Leela's eye 
is back to how it was before.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
It's good to have the old weird-looking 
Leela back.

<info>They hug.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess 
there's nothing wrong with being a little 
weird.

<character>FRY</character>
Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything.

<info>The kids say goodbye to Bender.</info>

<character>ALBERT</character>
We'll miss you, Daddy Bender.

<character>NINA</character>
We know robots don't have emotions but 
we drawed you this picture!

<info>She shows him a crude picture of him and the kids.</info>

<character>SALLY</character>
So if you ever miss us, even just a 
teeny bit, you can look at it.

<info>Bender takes the picture.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. 
Sheesh!  Hey, what the? Get away! Come 
on! I just got all the gum off of there! 
Hey! Hey! (shouting) I hate you! I hate 
you all!

<info>THE END</info></xml>
