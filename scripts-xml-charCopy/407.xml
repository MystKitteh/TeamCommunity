<info>Opening Credits. Caption: Psst...Big Party At Your House After 
The Show.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Hermes, Bender, Leela, Fry, Scruffy 
and Amy are gathered around watching the <character>TV</character>.</info>

<character>LINDA </character><info>ON TV</info>
Up next, daring daylight robbery at 
a municipal swimming pool.

<character>BENDER</character>
Ooo! This is it! Turn me up!

<info>Leela uses the remote to change Bender's volume control to maximum.</info>

<character>LINDA </character><info>ON TV</info>
Earlier today a foul mouthed bandit 
robbed the municipal pool, making off 
with the contents of over three lockers.

<character>BENDER</character>
More like three lockers and a sink!

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender? Did you have something to do 
with this?

<info>Hermes notices something Bender is wearing.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
Holy spitz! He's sportin' skintight 
speedos!

<character>AMY</character>
They don't leave much to the imagination.

<character>HERMES</character>
Actually on a robot they sorta do.

<character>MORBO </character><info>ON TV</info>
One puny human got a look at the robber...

<info>Bender leans forward and rubs his hands together.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Here we go here we go!

<character>MORBO </character><info>ON TV</info>
...describing him as a short, nasty, 
muscular...

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah make me famous big head!

<character>MORBO </character><info>ON TV</info>
...Caucasian human male.

<info>A picture appears on the screen of someone who looks nothing 
like Bender.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
What?

<info>He takes Fry's beer bottle and throws it at the <character>TV</character>.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch 
and drink all day?

<character>BENDER</character>
This is an outrage. What's the point 
of pulling the biggest pool caper ever, 
if nobody knows you did it?

<character>FRY</character>
Well there's the material rewards.

<character>BENDER</character>
You mean this junk?

<info>He opens his chest cabinet and water floods out along with a 
beach ball, a float, a bikini top and a small child.</info>

<character>BOY</character>
Wheeee!

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) All I ever wanted was for people 
to remember my name... (hoarse) it's 
Bender.

<info>Farnsworth, sat at the table, looks up from a book.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh fuff! What's the point in remembering 
something? You're just going to forget 
it five seconds later.

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) It's so unfair. A debonair 
robot with a zesty in-your-face outlook 
doomed to obscurity like the rest of 
you especially Leela! If I died tomorrow, 
no one would even notice.

<info>He slides out of the room on the float.</info>

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Boy, I've never seen him so down - or 
ever before.

<info>Cut to: Street. Bender walks sadly down the busy street.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
How does a nobody like me get famous? 
I know!  Hey look! I'm stuck! But I 
haven't given up hope! Call a soft news 
journalist!

<character>WOMAN</character>
You're not stuck.

<character>BENDER</character>
(sadly) Shut up.

<info>Time Lapse. Bender sees a group of roller-skaters ahead of him 
dancing. Skates come out of his shoes and he starts dancing.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey everyone do The Bender! This move's 
called The Bender!

<info>Everyone stops skating.</info>

<character>ROLLER</character>-<character>SKATER</character>
Yo hotwheels, this circle's about free 
expression, not fascist moves!

<info>He pushes Bender away.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Bender comes to the end of the street and sees a 
white, windowless building ahead of him. He gasps.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
A blank wall! Fame is mine!

<info>He runs towards the building, takes his head off and shakes 
it like a spray-paint can. His legs extend upwards towards the 
top of the building and he chuckles as he starts to spray his 
legacy onto the wall.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The next morning Bender stands back and admires 
his work. He has sprayed a huge picture of himself onto the wall 
along with "Bender Lives Large And Kicks Butt!"</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
There, now no one will forget how I 
lived or my attitude regarding butt.

<info>Behind him a crew of demolition workers arrive.</info>

<character>SAL</character>
Alrights ladies let's flush these artists 
lofts straights to hell!

<info>He turns a switch and cracks appear in the building.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(screaming) Nooo!

<info>The building collapses and Bender's picture folds inwards ï¿½ 
la Mad Magazine fold-ins. The picture of him has turned into 
a giant butt and the writing reads "Bender Licks Butt." The demolition 
crew laugh.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Attic. Bender enters the darkened lit only by 
light streaming through the window.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm the first one to work. A new low.

<info>The lights go on and the crew, dressed in black, jump out from 
behind the sofa.</info>

<character>ALL</character>
Surprise!

<info>Behind them is a coffin, a wreath, a bannner reding "R.I.P. 
Bender" and a photo of one of Bender's mug shots.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Happy funeral Bender!

<info>Bender gasps.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
A surprise funeral? For me?

<info>Fry pats him on the shoulder.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
We just wanted to show you that you 
really will be remembered.

<info>Bender climbs in.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Ooo! Cushiony! And a minibar!

<info>Hermes plays a jazzy tune and Fry stands in front of the congregation.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Dearly beloved, we are here today to 
remember Bender, taken from us in the 
prime of life, when he was crushed by 
a runaway semi, driven by the Incredible 
Hulk.

<character>BENDER</character>
Aww, you knew my favourite cause of 
death!

<character>FRY</character>
Now let us each remember the best things 
about Bender in our own way. Professor?

<info>Farnsworth stands up and clears his throat.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Your standard Bending Unit is made of 
an iron-osmium alloy. But Bender was 
different. Bender has a point-04% nickel 
impurity.

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) It's what made me me.

<info>Hermes stands up and takes Farnsworth's place.</info>

<character>HERMES</character>
If you ever needed a small package brought 
inot the country without a lot of X-raying 
and such, Bender always had a free body 
cavity.

<character>BENDER</character>
Eh, the Professor's was better.

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender shush. You're supposed to be 
dead.

<info>Bender sits up.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Say more about how great I am. And where's 
the crying? You people look like you're 
waiting for the bus.

<info>He lies back. Zoidberg makes a bagpipe noise with his mouth 
flaps.</info>

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(singing) Oh Danny-boy! The pipes, the 
pipes are calling...!

<info>Bender sits up again.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Who-y-boy?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(singing) ...From glen to glen and down 
-

<character>BENDER</character>
Danny-boy? You're at my funeral, singing 
about some dead stiff named Danny-boy? 
You really are a massive bonehead.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
I'm expressing my sorrow.

<character>BENDER</character>
Get lost. I'd say "Don't quit your day 
job!" but you're awful at that too.

<character>LEELA</character>
We're trying our best.

<character>BENDER</character>
Your best is an idiot. Let's pick it 
up people. So far it's been crap after 
crap! I croaked now show me some love!

<info>He lies down again. Amy stands up.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Bender was a truly special -

<character>BENDER</character>
Louder and sadder.

<character>AMY</character>
(shouting) Bender was a truly special 
-

<character>BENDER</character>
Next!

<info>Amy walks away crying. Preacherbot takes her place.</info>

<character>PREACHERBOT</character>
Dear Lord -

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh next!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(singing) Oh Danny-boy!

<info>Bender throws his glass at him. It breaks on his head and Zoidberg 
cries out in pain. Bender sits up.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Come on, surely there must be someone 
here who knows how great I was.

<info>Fry stands up.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Yes there is Bender. Bender was a lot 
of things to a lot of people, but looking 
back, the number one thing I can say 
about him is this, and simply this: 
Bender was my friend.

<info>Bender pauses in horror.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
What? That's it? Who are you? You're 
nobody! This is the worst funeral ever! 
I hope you're all happy. You've succeeded 
in convincing me life is worth living 
- by showing how bad my funeral will 
suck.

<info>He throws some flowers off the coffin and walks out. The flowers 
land on Farnsworth's lap.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
I know who's funeral we'll be attending 
next!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(bashful) Oh stop!

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. Bender sits reading Sullen Robot Magazine 
while Leela uses his hand to tighten a nut on the ship's steps. 
Enter Farnsworth.</info>

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
News everyone! Today you're going to 
Osiris 4 to deliver this enourmous sandstone 
block.

<info>He points to a massive block right next to him that is bigger 
than the ship.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I thought something looked different 
in here.

<info>Bender throws down his magazine, mutters to himself and walks 
onto the ship.</info>

<info>The ship flies towards Osiris 4 with the sandstone block tied 
to the top of the ship. It lands in a desert on the planet.</info>

<info>Osiris 4 Surface. Leela pulls the ropes away from the block. 
Fry talks to an Osiran and two Egyptian dog-like creatures. The 
man wears something similar to ancient Egyptian jewellery and 
his hair looks like it is made of solid gold.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hi, we have a giant stone to deliver 
- sign here.

<info>He hands the man a clipboard and he signs the invoice with an 
ancient Egyptian heiroglyph.</info>

<character>OSIRAN</character>
Ah, very nice. Much like the 10 million 
other identical stones used in the future 
tomb of our great Pharaoh Hermenthotip.

<info>He points to a sandstone building which is under construction.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Impressive, who's building it?

<character>OSIRAN</character>
You.

<character>LEELA</character>
Say again?

<character>OSIRAN</character>
You are now slaves of the great Pharaoh 
Hermenthotip. Guards.

<info>The guards shackle the crew to a pole and carry them away.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Call it a hunch but, I've got a bad 
feeling about this.

<info>Slave Boat. The slaves row a boat down a river past other slaves. 
The slaves are shackled to benches.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
You know the worst thing about being 
a slave? They make you work but they 
don't pay you or let you go.

<character>LEELA</character>
That's the only thing about being a 
slave!

<character>OSIRAN</character>
Attention. You are now possessions of 
the great Pharaoh Hermethotip, heir 
to the 10th dynasty, bringer of the 
good aspects of the annual floods.

<character>FRY</character>
Incredible. This place is just like 
the Ancient Egypt of my day.

<character>OSIRAN</character>
That is no coincidence. For our people 
visited your Egypt thousands of years 
ago.

<character>FRY</character>
I knew it! Insane theories: one! Regular 
theories: a billion!

<character>OSIRAN</character>
We learned many things from the mighty 
Egyptians, such as pyramid building, 
space travel and how to prepare our 
dead so as to scare Abbott and Costello.

<info>Fry laughs.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Also Wolfman!

<info>Bender whistles, impressed.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Look at these swanky tombs! These people 
really know how to die!

<character>LEELA</character>
Are you crazy? They worked thousands 
of people to death to make these stupid 
monuments.

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, you spend you're whole life building 
a guy's toe and you're gonna remember 
him!  I think I'm gonna like it here!

<info>Market. Fry, Leela and Bender walk through the market with the 
Osirian behind them. A man makes an enquiry at a Lose Weight 
Now - Ask Me How stall.</info>

<character>MAN #1</character>
Yeah, I uh, noticed your sign and I 
thought I'd come over here and look 
into getting involved in your program.

<character>MAN #2</character>
What we do is make you starve to death.

<info>Outside Hermenthotip's Tomb. The slaves pulls the giant sandstone 
block.</info>

<character>OSIRAN</character>
One two three - pull!  One two three 
- pull!

<info>He whips them again. The Australian man from the Spa 5 labour 
camp is with them.</info>

<character>AUSTRALIAN GUY</character>
Aw, bloody chunder!

<character>BENDER</character>
Pick it up people, we're enslaved here 
to do a job. Master? Do we have to count 
to three every time? Couldn't we just 
count to one. Or better yet one half?

<character>OSIRAN</character>
Good idea slave.  One half - pull!  
One half - pull!

<info>He whips them.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Now we're slavin'!

<info>Time Lapse. Fry pushes a block up the side of the tomb and Leela 
pulls one up using a rope and a pulley. The Osiran stands on 
top of the block and whips her as she pulls.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Back at the bottom of the tomb they pull another 
block.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Come on guy's, Pharaoh's countin' on 
us. Work faster, like this.  You call 
that motivating me? Don't just whip 
with your arms. The power comes from 
your hips. Like this.

<info>He takes the whip and whips himself. The rest of the slaves 
arrive with the block.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, quit giving the slave drivers 
pointers!

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, remember who your real friends 
are.

<character>BENDER</character>
I'll tell you who I remember.  Enupsis! 
Pleeltut! Whatsisname! He was the greatest 
of all.

<info>He salutes the tomb. Some horns blow.</info>

<character>OSIRAN</character>
Pharaoh Hermenthotip approaches.

<info>The slaves bow. The horn blowers are whipped and they blow again. 
Hermenthotip's boat is carried from the water by slaves who were 
underneath it the whole time. They gasp for air.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hurry! Hurry! Pharaoh's coming! Get 
that nose in place, come on!

<info>The slaves haul the nose onto the tomb. Hermenthotip walks off 
the boat and the slaves bow. He walks past them and looks at 
the tomb.</info>

<character>HERMENTHOTIP</character>
Excellent work! I am very proud of all 
you slaves.

<info>Bender stands up and cheers.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Woohoo! Viva Hermenthotip!

<character>HERMENTHOTIP</character>
And now, I have a grand announcement. 
In honour of your achievement, you're 
all hereby -

<info>The nose falls off the tomb and crushes him. The slaves gasp.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(screaming) Nooo!

<info>He runs forward and lifts the nose away from the Pharaoh.</info>

<character>HERMENTHOTIP</character>
(hoarse) Tell the slaves they can all 
go.

<character>BENDER</character>
Go faster? I told them but they're so 
damn lazy.

<character>HERMENTHOTIP</character>
(hoarse) No. I mean they are all free.

<character>BENDER</character>
Freeloading off you? I agree.

<character>HERMENTHOTIP</character>
(hoarse) No, I -

<info>He dies. The slavedriver puts a sheet over his body.</info>

<character>OSIRAN</character>
Pharaoh Hermenthotip is dead.

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) He's whippin' angels now.

<info>Time Lapse. Night has fallen and hndreds of slaves are gathered 
for Hermenthotip's funeral. Fry, Bender, Leela, the Australian 
Guy and some other slaves carry Hermenthotip's coffin and lower 
it into a hole.</info>

<character>HIGH PRIEST</character>
We commend the body of Hermenthotip 
to the abode of the damned. The damned 
good looking!  Pharaoh commanded me 
to tell that joke at his funeral.

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) I'll always remember you Hermenthotip!

<character>HIGH PRIEST</character>
To equip Pharaoh for his journey we 
bury him with his favourite possessions. 
Such as his heart and liver.  And the 
many goods he left in his royal garage. 
Also, this bag of cat's our culture 
considers holy.

<info>He tosses that in too.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. An pseudo-Elton John singer plays a piano and sings 
a song dedicated to the Pharaoh.</info>

<character>SINGER</character>
(singing) Pharaoh my God-king you are, 
cold and deceased. I used to have him 
sing...P-P-P-Pharaoh and his pets...but 
the years went by and Pharaoh died, 
Suzie will have joined him in the afterlife 
-

<info>The High Priest pushes him into the hole.</info>

<character>OSIRAN</character>
Hermenthotip is gone, the time to designate 
a new Pharaoh is at hand.

<info>The tomb lights up.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Wow!

<character>OSIRAN</character>
At dawn tomrrow the high priest will 
consult the Wall Of Prophecy to determine 
Hermenthotip's successor.

<info>He points across the river at the wall which has been lit up.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Woo!

<character>OSIRAN</character>
That concludes the funeral. You don't 
have to go home but you can't stay here.

<info>Liberty Meadows Slave Quarters. The slaves sit around in a room.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!

<character>SLAVE #1</character>
Yes! Tonight we are slaves to no one 
- except the rhythm!

<info>He starts playing some bongos. The Australian Guy stands up 
and plays some panpipes and another slave plays a tamborine.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Yeah! Play those bongos!

<character>FRY</character>
I'm gonna spin til I fall down!

<info>It doesn't take long. Bender laughs insanely and sneaks out.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Liberty Meadows Slave Quarters. Bender sees 
the dog-guards, with their backs to him. He takes a ball out 
of his chest cabinet and throws it. The dogs see it and run after 
it, barking. Bender runs off in the opposite direction.</info>

<info>Wall Of Prophecy. Bender sneaks around to the front of it and 
takes a hammer out of his chest cabinet.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
We interrupt this prophecy to bring 
you late breaking bulletin. He hammers 
the back of his head and creates and 
imprint of himself on the wall.

<info>Time Lapse. The next morning the High Priest and four others 
stand in front of the wall and the slaves watch.</info>

<character>HIGH PRIEST</character>
Great Wall Of Prophecy, reveal to us 
God's will that we will blindly obey.

<character>PRIESTS</character>
(chanting) Free us from thought and 
responsibility.

<character>HIGH PRIEST</character>
We shall read things off you.

<character>PRIESTS</character>
(chanting) Then do them.

<character>HIGH PRIEST</character>
Your words guide us.

<character>PRIESTS</character>
(chanting) We're dumb.

<info>The slaves watch from below.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
You know what else stinks about being 
a slave? The hours.

<info>Leela covers her face with her hand in disbelief.</info>

<character>HIGH PRIEST</character>
The prophecy is strange and...crudely 
drawn at best. It indicates that, we 
are "here" and our next Pharaoh is over 
there near some...tents.

<character>BENDER </character><info><character>FROM REEDS</character></info>
Those are waves jackass, it's supposed 
to be a river!

<info>The slaves murmur to each other.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, I think I know who the next Pharaoh 
is!

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh Lord!

<character>HIGH PRIEST</character>
We hear your voice great Pharaoh. Reveal 
yourself to us.

<info>Bender stands up.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Behold! I have emerged from the place 
of spells and fairies!

<character>HIGH PRIEST</character>
It is he. Just as the Wall Of Prophecy 
prophesied.  Long live Pharaoh Bender!

<info>All the slaves except Fry and Leela bow.</info>

<character>SLAVES</character>
(chanting) Long live Pharaoh Bender!

<character>LEELA</character>
This society is a bunch of idiots.

<info>Outside Pharaoh's Palace. The High Priest and priests stand 
on a balcony addressing the slaves.</info>

<character>HIGH PRIEST</character>
People of Osiris 4, please welcome a 
man who started as a slave but worked 
his way up to lord of all creation! 
Our new Pharaoh - Bender!

<info>The crowd cheers and Bender dances out to a riff of The Bangles' 
Walk Like An Egyptian.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Citizens of Me! The cruelty of the old 
Pharaoh is a thing of the past.  Let 
a whole new wave of cruelty wash over 
this lazy land.

<info>The crowd cheers then realises what he has said.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
What did he say?

<character>BENDER</character>
Hear the word of Pharaoh. Build unto 
me a statue of ridiculous proportion. 
One billion cubits in height......that 
I might be remembered for all eternity. 
And be quick about it!

<info>The slaves are whipped.</info>

<info>Bender's Statue. Fry and Leela crawl along the floor with Bender 
sat on a throne on their backs. An old slaves struggles as he 
pulls some logs.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Lowly slave. Why are you not working?

<character>SLAVE #2</character>
I am.

<character>BENDER</character>
I meant yourself to death.

<character>SLAVE #3</character>
Mighty Pharaoh, it hurts when I breathe.

<character>BENDER</character>
Well then what do you think you should 
stop doing?  Crawl pigs!

<info>He whips them.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Ow!

<info>They crawl forward.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
The Pharaoh has spoken.

<info>Montage The slaves haul Bender's statue's massive leg upright 
ï¿½ la The Ten Commandments as he watches from his palace. The 
ground shakes as the leg is moved into position. He whips two 
architects as they look at the design for the statue's ass. Fry 
takes a "1" to a " - Days Since Last Accident" sign. But instead 
of hammering the 1 on he hammers his hand to the sign. The 1 
falls to the ground and Fry bends down to pick it up but can't 
reach it.</info>

<info>The statue is almost finished. The statue's foot is positioned 
so it looks like it is about to crush Hermenthotip's tomb. Up 
in space the slaves, in spacesuits, lift Bender's antenna ball 
to the top of the statue. Bender floats near them wearing a jet 
pack.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Your task is nearly completed. Don't 
let down Pharaoh now.

<info>He whips them and glides away.</info>

<info>Literal Foot Of Bender's Statue. A stage has been set up and 
the Osirian and the priests stand next to something covered with 
a sheet.</info>

<character>OSIRAN</character>
The great monument is finished oh Pharaoh. 
And now, the unveiling.

<info>He pulls a sheet away revealing Bender underneath it. Bender 
looks up at the statue. Skeletons are sticking out of the foot. 
The statue speaks in a booming voice and it's mouth lights up 
with each syllable.</info>

<character>STATUE</character>
Remember me.  Remember me.  Remember 
me.

<character>OSIRAN</character>
Does it please you my lord?

<character>BENDER</character>
Hmm...its a good start. Uh...yeah it's 
definately big alright. I just wonder 
if it's too big y'know? I mean, are 
people gonna be remembering me or the 
statue?

<character>HIGH PRIEST</character>
But sire, we made it to your exact specifications.

<character>BENDER</character>
Too exact if you ask me. Tear it down 
and start again. But this time don't 
embarrass yourselves.

<info>He takes a sip of his drink. The Osiran walks behind him and 
he and the priests mutter something to each other. They jump 
forward and wrap Bender in bandages. The High Priest turns to 
the crowd.</info>

<character>HIGH PRIEST</character>
Ladies and gentlemen, the Pharaoh...suddenly 
died!

<info>The slaves cheer and the priests throw Bender into his tomb.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Good riddance.

<character>BENDER </character><info><character>FROM TOMB</character></info>
What about my servants?

<character>PRIEST</character>
Oh yeah.

<info>They throw in Fry and Leela and seal the tomb.</info>

<info>Cut to: Bender's Tomb. Fry and Leela hit the hard floor. Leela 
lights a match and Bender stands in front of the still wrapped 
in the bandages.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause 
if it isn't......we're in trouble!

<info>Bender pulls som bandages away from his face.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
You jerk. Why'd you have to drag us 
along?

<character>BENDER</character>
I wanted to watch you remember me.

<info>He turns a light on. The entire tomb is fitted out like a casino.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Did you really think you'd need all 
this junk in the afterlife?

<character>BENDER</character>
Afterlife? Pfft. If I thought I had 
to go through a whole other life I'd 
kill myself right now!

<character>LEELA</character>
Well rot in peace. Fry and I are leaving.

<character>BENDER</character>
Sorry but we're totally sealed in.  
Nothing can get in or out. Except millions 
of snakes.  Here, have a pomergranate 
scnapps from my private distillery and 
start sharing fond memories of me, Bender.

<info>Fry drinks some but spits it out.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
What proof is this? Some huge number?

<info>Leela lights the drink and it explodes.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
It's explosive! Maybe we could escape 
by setting fire to the distillery and 
blowing this whole place to rubble! 
Let's get a little kindling going!

<info>She breaks away part of the leg and stacks the wood underneath 
the distillery. Bender dives in front of her.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
No! You can't blow up my monument, I 
won't be remembered.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh right, how selfish of me. We'll just 
stay here forever. Hey Fry, remember 
that robot "Bender"?

<info>She nudges him.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell.  Did you 
hear something Leela?

<character>LEELA</character>
No. But I bet it wasn't someone who 
was good at stealing.

<info>Bender hits his head.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Stop it stop it! It's not right! You've 
crossed a line!

<character>FRY</character>
Hey Leela you know who I remember...?

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh please, let it be me!

<character>FRY</character>
...That guy who used to bend things. 
You know...?

<character>BENDER</character>
Me, please!

<character>FRY</character>
...Hermes.

<character>BENDER</character>
Alright alright! If it means that much 
to you, blow up my statue!

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh Bender! When did you come in? Hold 
still!  Let's blow this tomb!

<info>She lights the bandage.</info>

<info>Cut to: Osiris 4 Surface. The statue starts to shake and the 
foot splits apart. Bender, Leela and Fry run through the hole 
and past some slaves.</info>

<character>SLAVE #1</character>
Pharaoh Bender! He once more walks among 
the living!

<info>They run up the ship's steps.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Cockpit. Leela presses some buttons and the ship 
takes off. Bender looks at his statue through the windscreen 
as the ship rises past it.</info>

<character>STATUE</character>
Remember me!

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) I will. I will.  Please, just 
leave me alone.

<info>He turns around, hugs Leela and bursts into tears.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, I understand your desire to 
be remembered. But you don't need a 
statue for that.

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) I don't?

<character>LEELA</character>
No. You have your legacy as a brutal 
tyrannical dictator. And that will outlive 
any monument.

<character>BENDER</character>
You really think they'll remember me?

<character>FRY</character>
Absolutely.

<character>BENDER</character>
Well in that case. One planet down! 
Helmsman...

<info>Cut to: Outside Ship.</info>

<character>BENDER </character><info><character>FROM SHIP</character></info>
...set course for Earth!

<info>The ship flies towards a planet and he laughs insanely.</info>

<character>LEELA </character><info><character>FROM SHIP</character></info>
That's not Earth.

<character>BENDER </character><info><character>FROM SHIP</character></info>
Oh.

<info>The ship zooms away from the planet.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
