[Ships Rec Room. Fry and Bender play a futuristic version of 
chess. The pieces are holograms and include an Omicronian, a 
Trisolian, a Horrible Gelatinous Blob, one of Kif's people and 
one of Zoidberg's people.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six.  Check.

<character>BENDER</character>
Hmm. Get him, boys!

[Fry screams as Bender's pieces leap off the board and knock 
him to the floor and beat him up.]

<character>FRY</character>
(hoarse) Good move.

[Opening Credits. Caption: Not Y3K Compliant.]

[Planet Express: Lounge. Fry lies on the couch next to Bender 
and Leela leans against the wall reading Cosmopolitan. The door 
opens.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Good news, everyone.  We have a mission 
to further the noble cause of intergalactic 
peace.

<character>BENDER</character>
Nope. Watching cartoons.

<character>FRY</character>
Sorry.

[Leela tips them off the couch.]

<character>LEELA</character>
What's the mission?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
It's a delivery for the Democratic Order 
Of Planets.

[He points at the label on the package that says "DOOP." Fry 
looks at it.]

<character>FRY</character>
DOOP? What's that?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
It's similar to the United Nations from 
your time, Fry.

<character>FRY</character>
Uh...

<character>HERMES</character>
Or like the Federation from your Star 
Trek programme.

<character>FRY</character>
(getting it) Oh!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the 
DOOP's new headquarters.

<character>LEELA</character>
What are we delivering?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Something without which no ribbon-cutting 
ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial 
oversized scissors.

[He takes them out of the box and Leela takes them from him.]

<character>LEELA</character>
We'll get them there as quickly as we 
can.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Alright, but don't run with them.

[The Planet Express ship flies towards the ultra-modern new <character>DOOP </character>
space station located in the Neutral Zone and docks.]

[New DOOP Headquarters. The crew walk into the huge reception 
area.]

<character>FRY</character>
Wow! There's a million aliens. I've 
never seen anything so mind blowing. 
Ooh, a reception table with muffins!

[He runs across the room. Glab, one of Kif's people, stands at 
a podium. A grey man dressed in grey and an orange DOOP sash 
stands behind her.]

<character>GLAB</character>
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 
ribbon-cutting ceremony of the DOOP's 
magnificent new headquarters. A fitting 
home for an organisation that has fostered 
peace throughout the universe. Even 
between the Insectoids and the Space 
Lizards.

[A spotlight falls on a Space Lizard who is eating an Insectoid. 
He spits out the Insectoid and shakes it's hand. Everyone applauds. 
At the bar Fry picks at a muffin and chats up someone.]

<character>FRY</character>
So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?

[The woman is a huge ten-foot tall Neanderthal wearing leopard-skin 
and carrying a club.]

<character>AMAZONIAN</character>
Big rats there. Me crush with club.

<character>FRY</character>
That's so interesting. Maybe we could 
get to know each other over a coffee.

<character>GLAB</character>
I can think of no better place for this 
centre of diplomacy than here in orbit 
around the Neutral Planet.  What are 
your thoughts on this momentous occasion, 
Your Neutralness?

<character>NEUTRAL PRESIDENT</character>
I have no strong feelings one way or 
the other.

[Everyone cheers, except one man.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
I hate these filthy Neutrals, Kif. With 
enemies you know where they stand but 
with Neutrals, who knows? It sickens 
me.  Halt.  Why, Leela. I do believe 
we've met.

<character>BENDER</character>
(whispering) He means you guys did it.

<character>LEELA</character>
If you don't mind, we're here to deliver 
the scissors for the ribbon-cutting.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Then you're under arrest.

[He snatches the scissors away.]

<character>LEELA</character>
What for?

<character>ZAPP</character>
How do I know these scissors aren't 
part of some Neutral plot?

<character>LEELA</character>
But they're not even sharp. Who could 
I possibly hurt with them?

<character>ZAPP</character>
The Yarn People of Nylar 4?  So, a plan 
to assassinate a weird-looking alien 
with scissors. How very Neutral of you.

<character>LEELA</character>
What?

<character>ZAPP</character>
It was almost the perfect crime, but 
you forgot one thing: Rock crushes scissors 
... but paper covers rock ... and scissors 
cut paper. Kif, we have a conundrum. 
Search them for paper, and bring me 
a rock.

<character>KIF</character>
Why?

[Zapp stares at Leela.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
So beautiful, yet so neutral.  Drag 
them to the ship.

<character>GLAB</character>
And now, to cut the ribbon, the legendary 
DOOP captain who just returned from 
a triumphant carpet-bombing of Eden 
7, Zapp Brannigan.

[Everyone applauds and looks around in confusion. Zapp has gone.]

[Nimbus Bridge. The Nimbus has moved away from the headquarters. 
Leela, Fry and Bender are handcuffed on the deserted bridge. 
Zapp paces around.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
What makes a man turn neutral? Lust 
for gold? Power? Or were you just born 
with a heart full of neutrality?

[Kif points at the reception area on the viewscreen.]

<character>KIF</character>
Um, sir, you're supposed to be cutting 
the ribbon right now.

<character>ZAPP</character>
No matter. I'll simply cut it from here 
with the ships laser.

[He presses a button and a console comes out of the floor. Outside 
the ship a huge laser appears from a hatch.]

<character>KIF</character>
Sir, I don't think that's wise.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Kif, if there's one thing I don't need 
it's your I-don't-think-that's-wise 
attitude.

[He grabs a handle on the console and moves it through Stun, 
Kill and Hyperdeath �. He presses the "Fire" button and shoots 
a laser beam towards the space station.]

[Cut to: New DOOP Headquarters. The laser cuts the ribbon and 
everyone applauds. The laser carries on cutting and cuts a huge 
stone statue of Glab in half. Everyone gasps. The laser carries 
on cutting and everyone stands gobsmacked. The station starts 
rumbling and explodes. The reception area breaks off and hurtles 
off into space with everyone still screaming.]

[Cut to: Nimbus Bridge.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
Whoopsie-daisy.

[Former DOOP Headquarters. The building in Weehauken, New Jersey, 
is a ruin with boarded up windows and cracks in the walls. The 
DOOP representitives are gathered for Zapp's trial, which Glab 
precides. She bangs her gavel.]

<character>GLAB</character>
Zapp Brannigan, you stand accused of 
blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do 
you plead?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Absolutely 99% not guilty.

<character>GLAB</character>
Then the prosecutor will call his first 
witness.

[The prosecutor is a giant, green, chicken with tiny glasses 
perched on his beak. He stands up and speaks with a strong Southern 
American accent.]

<character>HYPER</character>-<character>CHICKEN</character>
Your Honour, I'm just a simple Hyper-Chicken 
from a backwoods asteroid but if it 
please the court I reckon I'll call 
the entire jury.

[Everyone gasps and murmurs.]

<character>GLAB</character>
I'm going to allow this.

<character>HYPER</character>-<character>CHICKEN</character>
Members of the jury ...  ... did y'all 
happen to catch a gander at who blew 
up that there DOOP headquarters?

[They point at Zapp.]

<character>JUROR #1</character>
(simultaneously) That's the guy, right 
there.

<character>JUROR #2</character>
(simultaneously) Oh, yeah, right there.

<character>SMALL GLURMO #1</character>
(simultaneously) That one.

<character>HYPER</character>-<character>CHICKEN</character>
And are y'all gonna vote to convict 
him?

<character>NEPTUNIAN</character>
(simultaneously) You'd better believe 
it.

<character>JUROR #1</character>
(simultaneously) You bet.

[Glab bangs her gavel.]

<character>GLAB</character>
The jury is instructed to disregard 
its own testimony.

<character>HYPER</character>-<character>CHICKEN</character>
Your Honour, the prosecution rests.

[He clucks and covers his face with his wing.]

<character>GLAB</character>
The evidence against Zapp Brannigan 
is strong. However, in light of his 
years of service, and the incompetence 
of this hillbilly prosecutor, I'm afraid 
I must dismiss all charges.

[The crowd murmurs.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I 
know the case is closed and you've rendered 
your verdict, but I wanna testify.

<character>GLAB</character>
I'm going to allow this.

[Time Lapse. Leela is sat in the witness box.]

<character>HYPER</character>-<character>CHICKEN</character>
Now, Miss Leela, on the date in question, 
were you or were you not wearing a hoop 
skirt?

<character>LEELA</character>
That's a stupid question. What matters 
is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain 
I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot 
blow up DOOP headquarters with my own 
eye.

[The crowd gasps. Zapp stands up.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
I'd like to cross-examine the witness.

<character>GLAB</character>
I'm going to allow this.

[Zapp paces past Leela.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
We've met before have we not?

<character>LEELA</character>
(reluctantly) Yes.

<character>ZAPP</character>
And on that occasion, did you have sex 
with someone? May I remind you you are 
still under oath.

[Leela sighs.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(reluctantly) Yes.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Please point out the person in this 
courtroom you had sex with.  And his 
name is?

<character>LEELA</character>
Zapp Brannigan.

<character>ZAPP</character>
The very same Zapp Brannigan who did 
not blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest 
my case.

<character>GLAB</character>
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you 
may begin your deliberations.

[The jury files out through one door and returns immediately 
through another. Small Glurmo #1 is the foreman.]

<character>SMALL GLURMO #1</character>
Your Honour, we have reached a verdict. 
We find the defendant ... guilty.

[Leela hoots.]

<character>GLAB</character>
Zapp Brannigan, you are hereby stripped 
of your rank as captain and dismissed 
from the DOOP.

[Zapp cries as he turns and walks towards the door. He stops 
before he reaches it and turns to the court.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
I'd like to make one final statement. 
Kif c'mere and hold up the flag.  And 
wave it a little for God's sakes. My 
friends, you can take away a man's title 
and his uniform but you can never take 
away his integrity or his honour. Plus 
it was mostly Kif's fault.

[Kif drops the flag.]

<character>KIF</character>
What?

<character>GLAB</character>
Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of 
your rank and dishonourably discharged.

[Kif stammers and sighs.]

[Outside Former DOOP Headquarters. Zapp and Kif emerge from the 
building in civilian clothes.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
One day a man has everything, the next 
day he blows up a $400 billion space 
station and the next day he has nothing. 
It makes you think.

<character>KIF</character>
No, it doesn't.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life 
as civilians.  That's an order, soldier.

[Kif reluctantly follows.]

[Montage Zapp and Kif wander through the streets of New New York 
to Harry Nilsson's Everybody's Talkin' � la Midnight Cowboy. 
They stare into the window of a cafe and watch people eating 
then turn to passers-by on the street. Kif starts to dance and 
Zapp holds up a pot which passers by drop money into. Later that 
night, Zapp stands on a street corner and a limo pulls up. The 
window goes down and Zapp winks and offers himself to Hattie. 
She shakes her head and points at Kif. Kif gasps and Zapp ushers 
him into the car. The door closes and it speeds off.]

[Planet Express: Hangar. Fry and Bender wash the ship.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, Bender?

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah?

[Fry squirts him with the hose and he giggles and throws his 
sponge at Fry, who ducks. The sponge flies over his head and 
hits Leela in the face.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Alright, this is the third hose fight 
I've broken up today and the second 
one using actual hoses. Now move your 
lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship 
like I ordered you to.

<character>FRY</character>
You don't have to get so mad, Leela.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of 
the dirt with his finger.

[He points at a doodle Fry has done of Leela and speech bubble 
with "Yak Yak Yak" in it. Leela growls. The doorbell rings and 
she goes to answer.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Entrance. She opens the door to a down-and-out 
Zapp and Kif.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Zapp?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. 
You're the only woman who ever loved 
me.

<character>LEELA</character>
I never loved you.

<character>ZAPP</character>
I mean physically.

<character>LEELA</character>
What do you want?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Just let me work for a little food. 
Perhaps I could paint a fence, or service 
you sexually, or mop the floors.

<character>LEELA</character>
You don't know how to do any of those 
things.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Kif might.

[Leela prepares to press the slam button when Farnsworth turns 
up.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Leela, who are you talking to?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. 
And his commanding officer.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Why, you're that disgraced starship 
captain.  Having him on staff will distract 
people from our horrendous safety record. 
Come in.

[Planet Express: Meeting Room. Zapp and Kif join the crew around 
the big table.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I'd like everyone to meet our new employees. 
(whispering) Which ones are new?

<character>HERMES</character>
The green dude and the fat man.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that 
robot before either.

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. 
Anyway, whoever you all are, I have 
good news. You'll be making a delivery 
to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high 
gravity you'll most likely be crushed 
under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy.

[The ship flies towards the green planet.]

[Cut to: Ships Cargo Bay. Zapp peers around the doorway and watches 
Leela pilot the ship. He turns away and the door closes.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
So, this Leela. I know she's a very 
sensuous woman but what manner of captain 
is she?

<character>FRY</character>
She's really strict.

<character>BENDER</character>
And mean.

<character>ZAPP</character>
I see. Does she by any chance give the 
crewmembers spankings?

<character>FRY</character>
No, she just makes us do work and stuff.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Good, good. But should she ever institute 
some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy 
let me go in your place. I won't have 
my comrades harmed.

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, this guy's alright!

[He takes some bottles of L�brau out of his chest cabinet and 
passes them around.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
Here's to us poor schmoes working for 
the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, 
female man.

[They guzzle down the beers.]

[The ship goes into orbit around the planet.]

[Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Kif stands next to Leela.]

<character>KIF</character>
I've computed out landing co-ordinates, 
Captain.

<character>LEELA</character>
Thanks, Kif. Very nice work.

[Kif sighs then stops.]

<character>KIF</character>
Wait, what?

<character>LEELA</character>
I said "very nice work".

<character>KIF</character>
This is the happiest day of my life.

[He hugs her.]

[Stumbos 4 Surface. The ship lands and the landing gear creaks 
and groans under the immense gravity.]

[Cut to: Ships Cargo Bay. Leela has assembled Fry, Bender and 
Zapp and holds a clipboard.]

<character>LEELA</character>
OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to 
delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel.

[She points through the window at a hotel on a hill. Bender holds 
a pillow.]

<character>BENDER</character>
They're not very heavy but you don't 
hear me not complaining.

<character>LEELA</character>
They're not heavy in here because we 
have an anti-grav pump. But once you 
get out on the surface the gravity will 
be very intense.

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect 
me.

[Leela rips it off him.]

<character>LEELA</character>
I don't want any screw-ups. Use the 
hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow 
at a time.

[She leaves.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all 
the pillows at once.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah!

<character>ZAPP</character>
That's using the old noodle!

[Stumbos 4 Surface. The ships cargo lift comes down and Zapp 
pushes the hover-dolly off it with all the pillows on it. The 
three are hit by the enormous gravity. Bender struggles to stay 
upright but his legs are crushed under him. Fry tries as well 
but his legs buckle. Zapp struggles too.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
Come on, girdle. Hold!

[His girdle breaks and his huge flabby gut spills out from under 
his sweatshirt. He groans. So does the hover-dolly. Then it breaks.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Uh-oh.

[Leela and Kif walk down the ships steps. Her hair is pushed 
flat and Kif is squished.]

<character>LEELA</character>
What the hell happened?

<character>BENDER</character>
Some breaking occured, the dolly was 
involved, that's about all we know.

<character>LEELA</character>
I told you dumb apes not to overload 
it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs 
here.

<character>FRY</character>
Alright, don't get your panties in a 
knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.

<character>BENDER</character>
I'll start loading up the pillows.

<character>LEELA</character>
No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, 
so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows 
by hand.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Let me ask you a serious question, Leela: 
Does the company that made your bra 
make a girdle as well? I ask because 
a friend of mine--

<character>LEELA</character>
Just get to work.

[Time Lapse. Fry, Zapp and Bender drag the pillows across the 
surface, leaving huge furrows in the ground.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(mocking) I'm Leela, get to work, neh 
neh neh.

<character>FRY</character>
I agree.

[Ships Cockpit. Leela looks bored stiff listening to Kif.]

<character>KIF</character>
The point is, it's just so humiliating 
working for that man. Once, he actually 
ordered me to ... shave his armpits 
while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--

<character>LEELA</character>
Y'know, why don't we talk about something 
besides Zapp for a while?

<character>KIF</character>
Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout 
then, um...OK, well, there he was in 
the tub, alright?

[Leela sighs.]

[Stumbos 4 Surface. Zapp, Fry and Bender continue the delivery. 
They struggle and stop. Thunder cracks above.]

<character>FRY</character>
Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. 
That'll cool us off.

[He holds his tongue out and the heavy rain knocks him to the 
ground. They crawl under a rock out of the rain.]

<character>BENDER</character>
This is all Leela's fault.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up 
dolly, we could have broken it, given 
up and gone home by now.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Y'know boys, a good captain needs many 
skills, such as boldness, daring and 
a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced 
Leela has any of those things.

<character>FRY</character>
Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish 
she didn't make us work so much.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Back when I was captain all I asked 
from my men was their complete loyalty. 
If I had that, then for all I cared 
they could sit around the whole day 
drinking beer in their underpants.

<character>BENDER</character>
Beer?

<character>FRY</character>
Underpants?

[He and Bender look at each other and grin.]

[Ships Cockpit.]

<character>KIF</character>
But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. 
I'm free!  Oh, you hear that? I'm actually 
laughing!

[Enter Zapp, Fry and Bender.]

<character>FRY</character>
This is a mutiny.

[Kif sighs.]

<character>BENDER</character>
You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the 
new captain.

[Zapp handcuffs Leela. Fry already has his shirt off and raises 
a beer.]

<character>FRY</character>
All hail the new captain.

[He unzips his trousers and lets them fall down.]

[The ship speeds away from Stumbos 4.]

[Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Zapp is sat in the pilot's seat.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
Leela, you might be a formidible do-er 
of the nasty but I am forced to relieve 
you of your post.

<character>LEELA</character>
On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her 
in the brig.

<character>FRY</character>
We don't have a brig.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Then throw her in the laundry room, 
which will hereafter be referred to 
as "the brig".

[Ships Laundry Room. Bender and Fry lead Leela inside.]

<character>LEELA</character>
You really don't want me to be captain 
anymore?

<character>BENDER</character>
You got it, genius.

<character>LEELA</character>
But, didn't I do a good job?

<character>FRY</character>
You were mean and you yelled and you 
made us do all that work.

<character>LEELA</character>
Sometimes a captain needs to do those 
things. Besides I, I thought we were 
friends.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been 
such a mean captain then.

[He turns and leaves.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Don't worry, Leela, soon we'll be able 
to look back on this and laugh.

[He walks out, looks back and laughs insanely.]

[Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Fry and Bender return. Zapp is wearing 
his DOOP uniform.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
Back in my old uniform, and it nearly 
still fits. Even after all that fattening 
hobo cuisine.

[Kif, back in his uniform too, holds up Zapp's other clothes.]

<character>KIF</character>
What shall I do with your civilian clothes, 
sir?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Take them to the laundry-brig.  So, 
do I have your loyalty, men?

<character>BENDER</character>
To the ends of the universe.

<character>FRY</character>
Ten hundred percent!

<character>ZAPP</character>
That's not nearly loyal enough. I order 
you to sit around and drink beer until 
you're as loyal as Kif here.

[He hands them some beers and Kif returns.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Yes, sir, sir!

<character>KIF</character>
Um, may I have a beer, sir?

<character>ZAPP</character>
No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, 
I have a plan. We will single-handedly 
attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet.

<character>KIF</character>
Oh, jeez.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Once the neutral war machine lies in 
ruins, I'll be a hero again and the 
DOOP will reinstate me as captain.

<character>KIF</character>
But, sir, that plan makes no sense.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall 
correctly, you were court-martialed 
in disgrace.

<character>FRY</character>
Ooh, burn!

<character>BENDER</character>
Nailed you, buddy!

[They clink their bottles.]

[The Planet Express ship flies towards the neutrally grey Neutral 
Planet.]

[Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Zapp is in the pilot's seat and Fry and 
Bender man their stations.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
Prepare to continue the epic struggle 
between good and neutral.

<character>FRY</character>
This is awesome! We're gonna be like 
pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like 
...  ... and then we'll have pancakes 
to celebrate and I'll be like...

[He makes pancake-eating noises.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
Precisely. Now, in the name of all that 
is good and honourable, we'll call the 
Neutral President with a message of 
peace, then blast him.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yes sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!

<character>ZAPP</character>
Fly the white flag of war.

[The white flag is hoisted on a flagpole atop the ships laser 
turret.]

[Neutral Capitol. The Neutral headquarters, located in Neutropolis, 
bears the motto "Live Free Or Don't". The Neutral President's 
office is quite small and decorated with various shades of grey. 
He sits at his desk and an aide stands next to him. Zapp is on 
a huge wall screen.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
This is Zapp Brannigan of the good 
ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come 
swinging the olive branch of peace.

<character>NEUTRAL PRESIDENT</character>
All I know is my gut says maybe.

[Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Zapp turns the communication screen off.]

<character>BENDER</character>
What now, chief?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, 
killing them in a hellish firestorm 
from which no living thing can escape.

<character>FRY</character>
Good, good, then what?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, 
will have ejected to safety, wearing 
the only spacesuit on board.

[Fry and Bender cheer and high-five.]

<character>FRY</character>
Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill 
us?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Of course. What do you think I meant 
by "loyalty"? Now help me into the only 
spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in 
there so you may need to apply baby 
powder.

[Ships Laundry Room. Leela, still handcuffed, folds some sheets 
while Kif pours some washing powder into a cup. Fry and Bender 
run in.]

<character>FRY</character>
Leela, we want you to be captain again.

<character>LEELA</character>
Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? 
He ran out of beer?  So he's about 
to kill us?

[They nod.]

[Ships Cockpit. Zapp is now wearing the spacesuit. Enter Leela, 
Kif, Fry and Bender.]

<character>FRY</character>
We want Leela to be captain again.

<character>ZAPP</character>
So it's mutiny is it? I never thought 
I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject. 
I found a children's spacesuit you can 
wear.

<character>KIF</character>
To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here 
with Captain Leela. She actually listens 
to what I have to--

[Leela shoves the helmet on his head and Zapp puts the suit on 
him which is decorated with stars and planets. He picks him up 
using a handle on the back and Kif kicks and mumbles before finally 
sighing. They leave the room and fly away from the ship. Leela 
wrestles with the wheel.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. 
We're gonna crash!

<character>BENDER</character>
Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess 
... and my banjo.  And Fry.

<character>LEELA</character>
OK, <character>OK</character>. We have one chance. Are you 
willing to do what I say as captain?

<character>FRY</character>
Absolutely.

<character>LEELA</character>
Even if I make you work hard?

<character>BENDER</character>
As your God is my witness.

<character>LEELA</character>
Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't 
break and load all the dark matter into 
the left engine.

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, man, that crap's heavy.

<character>FRY</character>
And warm.

<character>LEELA</character>
Just do it.

[The ship streaks through the planet's atmosphere and starts 
to burn up.]

[Cut to: Neutral Capitol. An alarm dings and the aide runs in.]

<character>NEUTRAL PRESIDENT</character>
If I don't survive, tell my wife, "Hello".

[Ships Cockpit. Leela turns on the communication screen.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age 
of 25.

<character>BENDER</character>
Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I 
wouldn't worry about it.

[Cut to: Ships Engine Room. Fry and Bender pull the dolly towards 
the left engine.]

<character>FRY</character>
It's too low.

<character>BENDER</character>
Quick.

[He lies underneath the dolly and Fry works him like a car jack, 
tipping the pellets into the fire.]

[Cut to: Outside Ship. The ships engine flares up and it turns 
away from the planet.]

[Ships Cockpit.]

<character>LEELA</character>
You did it! You actually did it!

[Fry and Bender cheer and high-five.]

<character>FRY</character>
And no one will have to punish anyone 
for the mutiny.

[Former DOOP Headquarters. Everyone is back in the courtroom 
again.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
And so, when Captain Leela panicked, 
perhaps distracted by female troubles, 
my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever 
I did to save the day.

<character>GLAB</character>
Captain Leela, is this rambling story 
of magic and heroism true?

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, actually--

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(whispering) That a girl! If they don't 
take him back we can keep him as captain.

[Zapp winks at Leela and click-clicks. She stands up.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Your Honour, it's all true: My female 
incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, 
the stuff that made no sense, all of 
it.

[The crowd gasps.]

<character>GLAB</character>
In that case, Zapp Brannigan, I hereby 
restore your rank and parking privileges.

[She bangs her gavel and the crowd cheers. Fry hugs Bender and 
high-fives Leela.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh, foo!

<character>ZAPP</character>
Come, Kif, we've got work to do.

[He mimes shaving his armpits and tosses Kif the razor. Kif sighs 
and turns to Leela.]

<character>KIF</character>
I-I'll call and tell you about it.

[She sighs.]

[Planet Express: Hangar. Leela looks over the railings and watches 
Fry and Bender scrub the ship.]

<character>FRY</character>
Leela, I just want you to know that 
even though you're mean, you're the 
best captain ever.

[Leela smiles.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can 
we have a week off?

<character>LEELA</character>
No.

<character>FRY</character>
Please?

<character>BENDER</character>
Come on, Captain.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, alright.

[Farnsworth passes behind her.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
No time off.

<character>FRY</character>
Aw, man.

<character>LEELA</character>
Let's mutiny!
