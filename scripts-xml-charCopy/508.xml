<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Zoidberg is sitting in a bathtub 
while Amy is sat at the table reading a book called Martians 
Are From Mars, Venusians Are From Venus. Enter Fry wearing a 
spacesuit.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Delivery boy Philip J. Fry reporting 
for duty.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Dr Zoidberg, soaking in brine.

<info>He relaxes and blows brine through his blowhole. It splatters 
on Amy who barely reacts.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
What is the meaning of this? We've got 
a delivery people, let's move, let's 
move!  Amy? Mission profile?  Interesting, 
interesting. Dr Zoidberg, mission bag?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Packed and ready sir.

<info>Fry takes the brown bag from him. Fry takes something out.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
What's this? This is the same toy surprise 
I got last time!  I can't work under 
these conditions. And without me there 
is no mission. I am the mission!

<info>The ship lands behind him and Bender and Leela walk out.</info>

<character>LEELA </character>(<character>SHOUTING</character>)
We're back from the mission!

<character>FRY</character>
Wh-what? You went without me?

<character>BENDER </character>(<character>SHOUTING</character>)
You were looking up curse words in the 
dictionary. It seemed like a better 
use of your time.

<character>FRY</character>
But, but I'm the delivery boy.

<character>LEELA</character>
Don't worry, everything went fine.

<character>BENDER</character>
Better than usual!

<character>LEELA</character>
We got medals! Good work team! We really 
pulled together on this one.

<character>BENDER</character>
Woo-hoo!

<info>He and Leela bump each other. Fry looks on sadly.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Locker Area. Leela blow dries her hair and Bender 
brushes his eyes with a toothbrush. Fry sits on the bench sadly.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I'm real sorry I missed the mission. 
I wasn't there and you might have needed 
me.

<character>BENDER</character>
Nope.

<character>FRY</character>
But if I'd been there I -

<character>BENDER</character>
Nope.

<character>FRY</character>
L -

<character>BENDER</character>
Nope.

<character>FRY</character>
Bender's great.

<character>BENDER</character>
Nope! Ohh!

<character>FRY</character>
Listen Leela, let me make it up by taking 
you out to dinner tonight.

<character>LEELA</character>
Nope. I've got a date with Chaz.

<character>FRY</character>
Chaz?

<character>LEELA</character>
I met him at that charity cock fight 
last week. He's the mayor's aide.

<character>BENDER</character>
Ooo, you go mutant girl!

<info>He whips her with his towel.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
I do go! He's a very important man.

<character>FRY</character>
So? I'm just as important as him.  It's 
just that, the kind of importance I 
have, it doesn't matter if I...don't 
do it.

<info>He slopes over sadly. Bender hangs his towel over him.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Bender and Fry sit on the couch. Fry 
sighs and strokes Nibbler.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I'm nobody. There are guys in the background 
with Mary Worth comics who are more 
important than me.

<character>BENDER</character>
Ah, buck up meatloaf. Bender'll take 
you out tonight and cheer you up. What 
do you wanna do? And I mean anything. 
You have the power! Name it an I'm there, 
you the man!

<character>FRY</character>
Um, <character>OK</character>. Let's go bowling.

<character>BENDER</character>
Nah.

<info>He puts his feet up and turns the TV on.</info>

<info>Elzar's Fine Cuisine Entrance. Enter Leela and her date Chaz. 
Enter Elzar.</info>

<character>ELZAR</character>
Table for two? Step right this way.

<character>CHAZ</character>
I'm afraid we don't have a reservation 
but uh, as you can see......I'm the 
mayor's aide. Table for two please.

<info>Elzar stares, confused.</info>

<character>ELZAR</character>
OK then.

<info>Cut to: Elzar's Fine Cuisine Restaurant. Elzar seats Chaz and 
Leela. Two chef's run out from the kitchen chasing a cockroach. 
It runs onto a table and Elzar whacks it with a piece of bread.</info>

<character>ELZAR</character>
Bam!

<character>CHAZ</character>
It's OK my man. I got you covered on 
your next health inspection.

<character>ELZAR</character>
I really appreciate that mister mayor's 
aide.  Here you go, compliments of the 
house.

<character>LEELA</character>
Wow, free bread at a restaurant? Is 
there anything you can't do?

<character>CHAZ</character>
I can't fail the mayor, not ever.

<info>Leela sighs, lovestruck.</info>

<info>O'Zorgnax's Pub. Fry sits at a table, lonely. He sees Leela 
and Chaz walk in.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Oh jeez, better not let Leela see me.

<character>LEELA</character>
Hey, I hear Fry.  Boy am I glad you're 
here!

<character>FRY</character>
You are? So things aren't working out 
with whatshisname?

<character>LEELA</character>
Actually...they are! Confidentially, 
I might not make it back to my apartment 
tonight! Could you walk Nibbler for 
me?

<info>She hands him her key.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Um..uh...

<character>LEELA</character>
And bring a baggy in case he drops a 
steamer. (shouting) Have a great night!

<info>Street. Fry walks down the empty street with Nibbler. Nibbler 
spies a lamppost and starts sniffing around it.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Oh no, please, no!  Perfect!

<info>Fry puts the bag over his hand and tries to lift the dark matter. 
He struggles. Smitty and <character>URL</character> approach him.</info>

<character>SMITTY</character>
Whoa, smells like a 289 in progress!

<character>URL</character>
Failure to scoop, aw yeah!

<info>He prints off a ticket.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Wait, I'm trying. It weighs as much 
as a thousand suns!

<info>He struggles with it some more. <character>URL</character> hands him the ticket. Chaz's 
car pulls up beside them.</info>

<character>CHAZ</character>
Don't worry Fry, I'll pull some strings. 
See if I can't get you tried as a juvenile!

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh Chaz!

<info>She hugs him and they drive off. Fry sighs.</info>

<info>Alley.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I'm as worthless as this trashcan.

<info>He kicks it over and sits down against a wall.</info>

<character>TRASHCAN</character>
You think I'm as worthless as you? Try 
catching garbage in your head and raising 
six kids you dumb townie!

<info>It rolls away. Garbage falls on Fry from a chute above him.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Oh Nibbler, at least I'm important to 
you. Even if it's only 'cause I clean 
up you poop.

<character>NIBBLER</character>
The poop eradication is but one aspect 
of your importance.

<info>Fry nods then realises Nibbler has just spoken. He screams.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
D-d-did you just talk?

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Indeed. And I have other amazing powers 
as well.

<character>FRY</character>
Like what?

<info>He punches Fry and knocks him unconcious.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Nibbler pulls his spaceship out from its hideaway 
and drags the still unconcious Fry into it. He comes around.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Are you my mommy?

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Negative.

<info>He closes the roof and takes off.</info>

<info>Planet Eternium. Nibbler lands his ship outside the Hall Of 
Eternity.</info>

<info>Cut to: Hall Of Eternity.</info>

<character>FIONA</character>
Welcome Lord Nibbler.

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Welcome acknowledged. I bring with me...the 
Mighty One.

<info>Fry wipes his nose on his sleeve.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Eh?

<character>KEN</character>
At last, our centuries upon centuries 
of waiting have achieved fruition.

<character>FRY</character>
Aww, aren't you a fuzzy wittle guy?

<info>He tickles Ken and he purrs.</info>

<character>KEN</character>
Stop that! Uh...please. Your mightiness 
-

<character>FRY</character>
Mightiness? Are you off your nut? I 
just got kidnapped by a bunch of guineapigs.

<info>The Nibblonians gasp and chatter.</info>

<character>KEN</character>
Does he not know?

<character>NIBBLER</character>
He does not know.

<character>FIONA</character>
He knows not?

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Knows not does he.

<character>NIBBLONIAN</character>
Not he knows?

<character>KEN</character>
Enough! Fry, it is my duty to inform 
you that the fate of humanity, the fate 
of our race, indeed the fate of all 
that exists and all that will exist 
rests with you. You are the single most 
important person in the universe.

<character>FRY</character>
Oh snap!

<info>Time Lapse.</info>

<character>NIBBLER</character>
On this auspicious occasion, let the 
Hall Of Eternity cut a thunderous blast.

<info>A Nibblonian feebly blows a trumpet. The floor opens and animals 
on plates rise up in front of the Nibblonians.</info>

<character>FIONA</character>
The Feast Of A Thousand Beasts is begun.

<info>They tuck in. Fry leaves his zebra.</info>

<character>NIBBLONIAN</character>
You gonna eat that?

<character>FRY</character>
Maybe later.

<info>The table sinks back into the floor.</info>

<info>Time Lapse.</info>

<character>KEN</character>
The time has come to discuss matters 
of the gravest importance.

<info>He pushes a button and images of the Brainspawn from The Day 
The Earth Stood Stupid appear on a screen.</info>

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Fry, do you remember some months ago 
when the Earth was attacked by flying 
brains?

<character>FRY</character>
Hmm, I remember the square dancing stomachs, 
although that might have been a milanta 
commerical. Wait! The brains! I do remember! 
But no one else does. They said I was 
crazy.

<character>KEN</character>
On the contrary. You remember beause 
you were the only one immune to the 
brain's mental attack.

<character>FRY</character>
Because I'm so smart?

<info>The Nibblonians laugh.</info>

<character>KEN</character>
Oh my. Anyway, your immunity is due 
to the fact that you lack the delta 
brainwave.  It's a genetic abnormality 
which resulted when you went back in 
time and performed certain actions which 
made you your own grandfather.

<character>FRY</character>
I did do the nasty in the pasty!

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Verily. And that past nastification 
is what shields you from the brains. 
You are the last hope of the universe.

<character>FRY</character>
So I really am important? How I feel 
when I'm drunk is correct?

<character>KEN</character>
Yes. Except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't 
rock.

<info>Nibblonian Spacecraft.</info>

<character>KEN</character>
For a thousand years, the evil brains 
have been constructing the giant Infosphere, 
a giant memory bank twice the size of 
three ordinary memory banks.

<character>FRY</character>
What's so evil about that?

<character>FIONA</character>
They plan to collect all the information 
in the universe and store it in the 
sphere.

<character>FRY</character>
So they're trying to learn things?

<character>FIONA</character>
Right.

<character>FRY</character>
Those bastards!

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Being brains, they feel compelled to 
know everything. And soon they will.

<character>FRY</character>
I'm as mad as I've ever been.

<character>KEN</character>
Once their task is complete, they will 
ensure no new information arises in 
the only way possible: by destroying 
the universe.

<character>FRY</character>
Now it's personal.

<character>FIONA</character>
Your mission is to infiltrate the Infosphere 
and plant this quantum-interphase bomb, 
blasting them into an alternate universe, 
from which there is no return.

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Then outrun the blast on this Scooty-Puff 
Jr.

<info>He winds the key in the back of the Scooty-Puff Jr. Fiona attaches 
the bomb to Fry's spacesuit.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
OK, let's go through this once more 
-

<info>The Nibblonians open the airlock and Fry is blown out into space. 
Fry screams. He rides the Scooty-Puff Jr towards the Infosphere. 
A swarm of brainsspawn fly past him and one hits him on the head.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Aah! Brains!

<info>Ken appears on Fry's arm communicator.</info>

<character>KEN </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
Fear not Mighty One, your missing brainwave 
makes you invisible to them. So long 
as you avoid intense thinking.

<character>FRY</character>
Sorry, what? I wasn't paying attention.

<character>KEN </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
That is most wise.

<character>FRY</character>
Who?

<info>Cut to: Outside Infosphere.</info>

<character>KEN </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
In a few seconds the brains will finish 
scanning the last bits of information 
in the universe.

<info>Brains float past a data port and it scans their information.</info>

<info>The scanning ends and the Infosphere initiates a self-scan.</info>

<character>KEN </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
Now the Infosphere will open it's protective 
crust so as to scan itself, completing 
it's thousand year task.

<info>The Infosphere opens and a scanner comes out. It slowing begins 
to rotate around the Infosphere, scanning as it goes and making 
a noise like a connecting modem.</info>

<character>FIONA </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
This is your one chance to enter the 
sphere! Scoot! Scoot now!

<info>Fry scoots through the Infosphere's crust.</info>

<info>Cut to: Infosphere. The place is swarming with brains and in 
the centre of the sphere is a huge master brain. Fry scoots towards 
it and crashes into it. He climbs to the top where there is a 
computer console.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I'm at the input console. I'm a little 
nervous and I've got brain in my buttcrack.

<character>NIBBLER </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
Roger.

<info>Fry attaches the bomb to the console.</info>

<character>KEN </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
Once you press the detonator, you will 
have 60 seconds for an exciting escape.

<info>Fry is about to push the button but hesitates.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hey wait, this brain knows everything 
about everything right?

<character>KEN </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
It will soon. That's why you're supposed 
to be setting off a bomb.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah yeah, but I can't pass up a chance 
to learn the answers to the greatest 
questions of all time.  Is it true that 
post-it stamp glue is made up of -

<character>INFOSPHERE BRAIN</character>
Correct. Toad mucus.

<info>On the console screen is a video clip of a postman squeezing 
a toad so it's mucus drips into a bucket.</info>

<character>KEN </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
There's no time for this. Activate the 
bomb.

<character>FRY</character>
Wait wait wait.  What really killed 
the dinosaurs?

<character>INFOSPHERE BRAIN</character>
Me!

<info>On the screen is a video clips of the brain flying over the 
dinosaurs and killing them. A message appears on the screen and 
a computer voice speaks.</info>

<character>COMPUTER VOICE</character>
Unauthorised Data Access.

<info>An alarm goes off and brains surround Fry. Fry screams and starts 
to wind his Scooty-Puff Jr. It falls apart in his hands.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Uh oh.

<character>GIANT BRAIN</character>
Detecting trace amounts of mental activity. 
Possibly a dead weasel or a cartoon 
viewer.

<info>The brains zap Fry.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Eww gross. Cut it out!

<character>BRAIN #1</character>
Odd. He is immune to our sionic attack.

<character>BRAIN #2</character>
Impossible. We're an ambitious young 
squad with everything to prove.

<character>GIANT BRAIN</character>
It appears we are in the presence of 
the fabled one. But without his Scooty-Puff 
Jr, he cannot escape.  Huh?

<character>BRAIN #2</character>
A quantum-interphase bomb? Are you insane 
in the membrane?

<character>FRY</character>
You got it poindexter!

<info>He activates the bomb.</info>

<character>BRAIN #1</character>
Oh, not good!

<character>COMPUTER VOICE</character>
Detonation in T-60 Earth seconds.

<character>BRAIN #3</character>
You fool. You'll be transported to the 
other universe with us. Trapped there 
for all eternity.

<character>BRAIN #1</character>
And we'll form a tightly-knit clique, 
that you won't be part of!

<character>FRY</character>
Well at least I did one important thing 
with my life. Leading good to victory 
over evil!

<info>The Nibblonians cheer.</info>

<character>KEN </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
Exactly!

<character>GIANT BRAIN</character>
The Nibblonians? Good? During your last 
moments in this universe perhaps you 
should query our database concerning 
the night of December 31st 1999.

<character>FRY</character>
The day I got frozen? What about it?

<character>NIBBLER </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
No! Don't ask about that! It, it would 
be uh...boring!

<character>FRY</character>
Eh forget it then.

<character>GIANT BRAIN</character>
Query!

<character>FRY</character>
OK sheesh!  What happened to me, Philip 
J. Fry, on the night of December 31st 
1999?

<character>INFOSPHERE BRAIN</character>
Clarification request. Are you the Philip 
J. Fry from Earth or the Philip J. Fry 
from Hovering Squidworld 97A?

<character>GIANT BRAIN</character>
Earth you fat idiot! Hurry up!

<info>On the console's screen Fry walks into the cryogenics lab.</info>

<character>FRY </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
Hello? Pizza delivery for uh...I. C. 
Wiener? Aw crud!

<character>FRY</character>
Eurgh! I can't believe how fat I look! 
Aw, Nibbler's there. Wait! What?!

<info>On the screen Nibbler blows Fry's tilting chair. Fry begins 
to lose his balance and the chair tips back. Fry rolls back into 
the cryo-freezer.</info>

<character>FRY </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
What the?

<info>He panics. The cryo-freezer freezes him in a flash.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I, I don't understand. You made me go 
in the freezer tube?

<character>COMPUTER VOICE</character>
Detonation in T-15 seconds.

<character>FRY</character>
You little runts froze me! You took 
away my life!

<character>NIBBLER </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
We can explain!

<character>FRY</character>
No you can't. Shut your adorable trap!

<character>NIBBLER </character><info>ON <character>SCREEN</character></info>
We had no choice. You were the only 
one who could help us. What is one life 
weighed against the entire universe?

<character>FRY </character>(<character>CRYING</character>)
But it was my life.

<character>COMPUTER VOICE</character>
Detonation in 2, 1. Will the owner of 
a white Pontiac Firebird...oh nevermind. 
Zero!

<info>Cut to: Outside Infosphere. The bomb explodes and the Infosphere 
is sucked into the alternate universe.</info>

<info>Cut to: Infosphere. It reappears in the alternate universe.</info>

<character>GIANT BRAIN</character>
Well, here we are. Trapped for eternity.

<character>BRAIN #2</character>
We could sing American Pie.

<character>FRY</character>
Go ahead. I deserve it. I wish those 
stupid racoons had never brought me 
to the future.

<character>INFOSPHERE BRAIN</character>
I have shocking data relevant to this 
conversation.

<character>GIANT BRAIN</character>
We don't care you dope! We're in another 
universe, you're not in charge anymore.

<character>INFOSPHERE BRAIN</character>
It is possible for the Philip Fry to 
resume his life on December 31st 1999.

<character>FRY</character>
Really? I can go back in time?

<info>An image appears on the console.</info>

<character>INFOSPHERE BRAIN</character>
There is a nexus point between universes, 
at the space-time you entered the cryogenic 
tube. You and only you can return there.

<character>GIANT BRAIN</character>
Interesting. You could stop the Nibblonian 
from pushing you into the cryogenic 
tube.

<character>FRY</character>
That is interesting. Why?

<character>GIANT BRAIN</character>
It would be as if you never came to 
the future. You will have your life 
back and we will suceed in our plan 
to understand and destroy the universe.

<character>FRY</character>
Everybody wins!

<character>BRAIN #2</character>
The human will be returned to the past!

<info>Outside Rocket Skating Rink.</info>

<character>NARRATOR</character>
Meanwhile...

<character>LEELA</character>
I love rocket skating! But the wait 
is always so long. Fry once stood in 
line for six hours just to get me a 
ticket.

<character>CHAZ</character>
Six hours? Pfft. Sounds like a real 
nobody! But now it's time for somebody 
and some chick he's with to go skating.

<info>He shows Leela a sign. Closed For Private Function. She gasps.</info>

<info>Cut to: Rocket Skating Rink.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
You reserved the whole rink?

<character>CHAZ</character>
Yup. Buzzed ahead, let 'em know who's 
aide was coming by. The mayor's, that's 
who's.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh Chaz!

<info>She kisses him.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela and Chaz are now skating around the rink. 
The kids from the Cookieville Orphanarium look on sadly.</info>

<character>SALLY</character>
Mr Vogel. I thought we was going skating.

<character>VOGEL</character>
No. We're not important enough. Everybody 
just hold hands until the bus driver 
gets back from his haircut.

<info>Leela notices the orphans.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Aww, let's let those kids skate with 
us.

<character>CHAZ</character>
What? Seriously? I'm trying to impress 
you with my cloud here.!

<character>LEELA</character>
I know, and it's working. But think 
how much skating would mean to those 
kids.

<character>ORPHAN</character>
We came here instead of eating today.

<character>LEELA</character>
This may be their only chance to skate 
in their whole lives. Who are we to 
say they can't?

<character>CHAZ</character>
The mayor's aide, and his badge! (shouting) 
Beat it kids! Come back when you got 
connections.

<info>The kids look away sadly.</info>

<character>VOGEL</character>
Alright kids. Back to the Orphanarium. 
You can slide around the gym in your 
socks.

<character>SALLY</character>
What socks?

<character>CHAZ</character>
So am I gonna get lucky tonight or what?

<info>Leela snatches his badge away from him and stuffs it down his 
throat.</info>

<info>Infosphere. The Infosphere Brain types something into to the 
console. It holds Fry in place.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I hope your calculations are correct.

<character>GIANT BRAIN</character>
Our calculations are always correct. 
For we are gigantic brains.

<character>BRAIN #2</character>
Initiate space-time transfer.

<info>The Infosphere throws a switch and the console zaps Fry and 
makes him go all spliggly. He disappears.</info>

<info>Old New York: December 31st 1999. In a telephone box Nibbler 
makes a phonecall to Panucci's Pizza.</info>

<character>NIBBLER</character>
I hereby place and order for one cheese 
pizza.

<character>PANUCCI </character><info>ON <character>PHONE</character></info>
One pie, nothing good on it. Name?

<character>NIBBLER</character>
I-period C-period Wiener.

<character>PANUCCI </character><info>ON <character>PHONE</character></info>
Uh, talk a little louder. It's sounds 
like you got some kind of tiny head 
on you or something.

<info>Cryogenics Lab. Nibbler paces around under the desk. Enter Fry.</info>

<character>PAST FRY</character>
Hellooo? Pizza delivery for uh, Icy 
Wiener? Wiener? Aw crud.

<info>Behind Nibbler, in the corner of the desk Future Fry appears 
and grabs him.</info>

<character>FUTURE FRY</character>
Gotcha!

<info>Nibbler squeals.</info>

<character>NIBBLER</character>
I don't understand.

<character>FUTURE FRY</character>
Yes you do! You came back in time to 
knock me into that freezer. Now I came 
back in time to stop you.

<character>NIBBLER</character>
I did not come back in time. My people 
lack that ability.

<character>FUTURE FRY</character>
But, I know you in the future. I cleaned 
your poop.

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Quite possible. We live long and are 
celebrated poopers. You will meet me 
when I'm a thousand years older.

<character>FUTURE FRY</character>
Not if you don't freeze me.

<info>Past Fry sits down on the chair and puts his feet up on the 
desk.</info>

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Please. Our saviours foresee that in 
a thousand years, at one moment, the 
fate of the universe will depend on 
you. Since you will not live that long 
I must freeze you now.

<character>FUTURE FRY</character>
Well, why couldn't you just ask me?

<character>NIBBLER</character>
We were afraid you would refuse.

<character>FUTURE FRY</character>
Of course not, I love the future.

<character>NIBBLER </character>(<character>CHOKING</character>)
Then why are you choking me right now?

<character>FUTURE FRY</character>
Because I don't like being used.

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Well now it's your choice. Is there 
nothing in the future worth saving?

<character>FUTURE FRY</character>
Leela. But she doesn't think much of 
me.

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Ah, she must be the other.

<character>FUTURE FRY</character>
Wha?

<info>Past Fry's chair starts to tumble back. Future Fry holds the 
leg.</info>

<character>NIBBLER</character>
You must not give up on her. I am stationed 
on a distant world known as Vergon 6. 
But if you return to the future I will 
transfer to Earth to give you what help 
I can.

<info>Outside, the countdown to the millenium begins.</info>

<character>FUTURE FRY</character>
You really think I would have had a 
chance with Leela?

<character>NIBBLER</character>
You must choose. The present or the 
future? To save yourself? Or to save 
Leela?

<info>The countdown reaches 1. Past Fry leans back on his chair and 
blows his party blower. Future Fry blows the chair and Past Fry 
tumbles back into the cryotube which freezes him.</info>

<character>FUTURE FRY</character>
Yes! Here I come future! Oh no! Wait! 
I'm gonna get trapped in the Infosphere 
again! Just remember that Scooty-Puff 
Jr sucks...

<info>He fades away into nothingness.</info>

<character>NIBBLER</character>
In a thousand years I'll get right on 
it.

<info>Outside Infosphere. The bomb explodes and the Infosphere is 
sucked into an alternate universe.</info>

<character>NARRATOR</character>
And so, a thousand years later Fry once 
again infiltrated the Infosphere and 
set off his amazing bomb. Only this 
time...

<info>Fry speeds away from the Infosphere on his huge Scooty-Puff 
Sr.</info>

<info>Alley. Nibbler's ship lands and Fry and Nibbler climb out.</info>

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Thank you for saving the universe Fry. 
Here.

<character>FRY</character>
Whoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour 
again, just ask.

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Oh we will. We will.

<info>He shuts his ship away and puts his leash on.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Man, I can't wait to tell everyone what 
happened.

<character>NIBBLER</character>
Uh yes. Incidentally I need to remain 
undercover so I'm blanking your memory.

<info>His third eye flashes like the memory stick from Men In Black 
and Fry looks dazed.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Huh. Did everything just taste purple 
for a second? Oh well. Let's go home 
you dumb poop machine.

<info>Nibbler chatters.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Leela holds up a photo of her and Chaz.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, would you do the honours?

<character>BENDER</character>
With gusto.

<info>He scorches a hole in the photo. Leela looks at it satisfied. 
Chaz's head has been burnt away. Enter Fry. His head appears 
in the hole.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Hey Leela. I guess I got this for you.

<info>He hands her the flower.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh. Thank you. You know what Fry. I 
don't care if you're not the most important 
person in the universe. It really makes 
me happy to see you right now.

<character>FRY</character>
Then I am the most important person 
in the universe.

<info>She kisses him.</info>

<info>THE END</info>

<character>FRY </character>(<character>OVER CREDITS</character>)
Yes!
