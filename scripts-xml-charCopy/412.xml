<info>Opening Credits. Caption: Where No Fan Has Gone Before.</info>

<info>In the establishing shot, Star Trek-like music plays and the 
Planet Express ship flies through space with the trademark warp 
nacelles featured in Star Trek attached to it.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
(voice-over) Shatner's log, airdate 
... unknown.

<info>Cut to: Ships Cargo Bay. The room has been converted to resemble 
a court setting. Zapp Brannigan is judge while Bender and Leela 
sit with the heads in jars of William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, 
George Takei, Walter Koenig, DeForest Kelley and Nichelle Nichols.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
The impossible has happened. It would 
take days to recount the events I have 
witnessed. So, settle in. It all began--

<character>ZAPP</character>
Quiet, you! This court martial is now 
in session. The honourably sexy Zapp 
Brannigan residing. Bring in the accused.

<info>Kif wheels in Fry in the wheelchair used by Captain Pike in 
the Star Trek episode The Menagerie. Fry looks paralysed. The 
heads gasp.</info>

<character>TAKEI</character>
Oh, my!

<character>ZAPP</character>
Philip J. Fry, you stand accused of 
travelling to the forbidden planet Omega 
3, a crime punishable by 12 concurrent 
death sentences. Do you understand the 
charges?

<info>Kif leans over Fry's shoulder.</info>

<character>KIF</character>
One beep for "yes", two beeps for "no".

<info>Fry beeps once.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
"Yes". So noted. Do you plead guilty? 
Double "yes". Guilty! I will now carry 
out the punishment. Kif, my gun.

<character>LEELA</character>
Wait! He plead not guilty.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Order!  Order in the court! Very well 
then, Mr. Fry. Please recount the events 
that led you to be guilty.

<info>Fry beeps in Morse code.</info>

<info>Flashback. "A Few Days Earlier".</info>

<info>Rent-A-Wreck Video. Fry, Leela, Bender and Zoidberg look at 
the videos on the shelves.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
The Professor said he was taking a brief 
nap, so we only have time for six movies.

<info>Bender scoops up some videos.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Lets take these six Jim Carrey movies 
and record over them.

<character>FRY</character>
You know what movies average out to 
be really good? The first six Star Trek 
movies!

<info>The rest of the crew gasp, a camera zooms in on Fry and other 
customers panic.</info>

<character>CLERK</character>
(shouting) Everybody hit the deck!

<info>Everybody falls to the floor.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
(whispering) Sh! Those words are forbidden!

<character>FRY</character>
What words? Star Trek?

<info>A klaxon goes off and a red light flashes.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Sh!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Shut your gills!

<info>A siren is heard from outside.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide 
him!

<info>Leela and Zoidberg grab Fry and stuff him in Bender's chest 
cabinet.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Rent-A-Wreck Video. Leela, Bender and Zoidberg 
leave as Smitty and <character>URL</character> pull up and run into the shop without 
noticing them.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<info>Fade to: Ships Cargo Bay. Fry is still beeping.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
The court is intrigued. Perhaps we could 
hear more about these forbidden words 
from someone with a sexilly seductive 
voice.

<info>Nichelle Nichols is about to speak.</info>

<character>TAKEI</character>
With pleasure. You see, the show was 
banned after the Star Trek wars.

<character>ZAPP</character>
You mean after the vast migration of 
Star Wars fans?

<character>NICHOLS</character>
No, that was the Star Wars trek.  By 
the 23rd century, Star Trek fandom had 
evolved from a loose association of 
nerds with skin problems into a full-blown 
religion.

<info>On the screen, a service is held at the Church Of Trek.</info>

<character>PRIEST</character>
And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon 
ship where they would be no Tribble 
at all.

<character>CONGREGATION</character>
All power to the engines.

<character>NICHOLS</character>
As country after country fell under 
its influence, world leaders became 
threatened by the movements power.  
And so the Trekkies were executed in 
the manner most befitting virgins.

<info>On the rim of a volcano two men throw Trekkies into the flames.</info>

<character>MAN</character>
He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!  He's 
dead, Jim!

<character>NICHOLS</character>
Finally, the sacred texts were banned.

<info>The episodes are put inside a torpedo casing.</info>

<character>TAKEI</character>
The last copies of the 79 episodes and 
six movies were dumped on the forbidden 
world Omega 3. Along with that blooper 
reel where the door doesn't close all 
the way.

<info>As he speaks a ship that looks like an Eagle from Space 1999 
fires the torpedo. It hits the planet like Spock's coffin hit 
the Genesis planet in Star Trek: The Wrath Of Khan. The video 
ends.</info>

<character>NIMOY</character>
Thus, Star Trek was forever scoured 
from human memory.

<character>BENDER</character>
Another classic science-fiction show 
cancelled before its time.

<info>Zapp tuts.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
I've never heard of such a brutal and 
shocking injustice that I cared so little 
about. Next witness.

<character>KIF</character>
Bender the robot, please take the stand.

<info>Fry steps out of the wheelchair, perfectly healthy.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
She's all yours, buddy!

<info>Bender gets in.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, 
but I knew he was up to no good.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Please use the beeps.

<info>Bender grumbles and starts to beep.</info>

<info>Flashback.</info>

<info>Fade to: Head Museum. Fry runs into the 20th century room.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard 
what happened centuries ago. I can't 
believe your show was banned.

<character>NIMOY</character>
I have absolutely no idea what you're 
talking about.

<info>A camera tracks Fry but he ignores it.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
You know? 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 
good ones.

<character>NIMOY</character>
Oh, really, I've done too many things 
to remember one particular TV series. 
But if-if you want to discuss my books 
of poetry--

<character>FRY</character>
Come on! Remember that episode where 
you go high on spores and smacked Kirk 
around?

<character>NIMOY</character>
No. Perhaps you're thinking of my one 
man show about Vincent van Spock-- Uh, 
uh, I mean van Gogh! Damn!

<character>FRY</character>
Aha! You can't escape it!

<character>NIMOY</character>
(crying) Oh, you're right, I can't.

<character>FRY</character>
Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK 
I outwitted you, but--

<character>NIMOY</character>
(crying) No, it's my fellow cast members. 
300 years ago they left Earth behind.

<info>Flashback ... again.</info>

<info>Fade to: Launch Pad. Star Trek cast members' heads in jars are 
loaded into a rocket.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
This planet doesn't appreciate us anymore, 
Leonard.

<character>NIMOY</character>
Bill, you are, and always shall be, 
my friend. But I just signed a six-month 
lease on my apartment. I can't walk 
away from a commitment like that.

<character>SHATNER</character>
Very well, my friend.

<info>His jar is loaded into the rocket. The rocket blasts off leaving 
Nimoy behind.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<info>Fade to: Head Museum. Nimoy sobs.</info>

<character>NIMOY</character>
(crying) Why did the world turn its 
back on our obvious greatness?

<character>FRY</character>
I'm literally angry with rage! Your 
co-stars may be gone but we can still 
get those episode tapes back for the 
whole world to see. Come on!

<character>NIMOY</character>
Oh!

<info>He grabs Nimoy's jar from the shelf, tucks it under his arm 
and runs out. Jonathan Frakes' jar hops forward.</info>

<character>FRAKES</character>
Yes! Front row!

<info>Ships Cockpit. The ship is in the hangar and Fry starts to power 
it up.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
You can't go to Omega 3; It's forbidden! 
I forbid you!

<character>FRY</character>
But we have to! The world needs Star 
Trek to give people hope for the future.

<character>LEELA</character>
But it's set 800 years in the past!

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah, why is this so important to you?

<character>FRY</character>
'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like 
how you should accept people, whether 
they be black, white, Klingon or even 
female. But most importantly, when I 
didn't have any friends, it made me 
feel like maybe I did.

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I 
guess I can't let you go alone.

<character>BENDER</character>
I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, 
of course.

<info>Nimoy nods.</info>

<info>The ship flies into a solar system.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
We're entering the Omega system.

<info>An alarm goes off.</info>

<character>COMPUTER VOICE</character>
Warning: You are now in forbidden space.

<character>BENDER</character>
Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they 
gonna do, write a letter? (sarcastic) 
Ooh, I'm so scared!

<info>The ship shakes and another alarms goes off.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
I've lost control of the ship!

<info>Bender panics.</info>

<info>Cut to: Omega 3 Surface. The ship hits the surface, flips over 
and lands upside down. The crew get out, Fry carrying Nimoy. 
Bender lights a cigar and Leela gasps.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, dip!

<character>NIMOY</character>
Dip, indeed!

<info>They look around in amazement. There are Star Trek props and 
sets everywhere.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
It's all stuff from that forbidden show.

<character>NIMOY</character>
So many cardboard sets, so many memories. 
If only the others--

<character>SHATNER</character>
I guess that's my cue.

<info>He steps out of the "Guardian of Forever" prop with a body and 
wearing a yellow Star Trek uniform.</info>

<character>NIMOY</character>
Bill!

<character>SHATNER</character>
L-Dog!

<character>NIMOY</character>
(laughing) Hey! This is wonderful!

<character>SHATNER</character>
Oh, man.

<character>NIMOY</character>
I feel like hugging you.

<character>SHATNER</character>
Well I would except you have no body! 
And we're both men.

<info>Nichelle Nichols steps out, also with a body. She is followed 
by the other actors.</info>

<character>NIMOY</character>
Nichelle! George! Walter! DeForest! 
Welshy!

<character>FRY</character>
Welshy?

<character>NICHOLS</character>
We did some musical reunion specials 
in the 2200's but the guy who played 
Scotty had trouble yodelling.

<character>TAKEI</character>
Ever since then, Welshy has been a welcome 
participant in our escapades.

<info>Welshy says something in Welsh.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I can't believe it! How'd you all end 
up here?

<character>SHATNER</character>
We were on our way to Welshy's cousin's 
house to stay in the guest room when 
our ship was pulled down to this planet 
and crashed, just like yours.

<character>KOENIG</character>
When we woke up, we had these bodies.

<character>FRY</character>
Say it in Russian!

<info>Koenig sighs.</info>

<character>KOENIG</character>
Ven ve voke up ve had these wodies.

<info>Fry squeals.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Now say "nuclear wessels"!

<character>KOENIG</character>
No!

<character>TAKEI</character>
You'll love it here. Everything is provided 
for us. And we never age. Check out 
these abs!

<info>He rips his shirt revealing his body.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Yowza!

<character>LEELA</character>
But who's doing all this for you?

<character>SHATNER</character>
You know, we never thought about it. 
We're famous celebrities -- we're used 
to this sort of treatment.

<info>A deep, booming voice interrupts them.</info>

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
It is I!

<info>Everyone gasps and looks up. Above them is a hovering, green 
cloud.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoa! What a cheesy effect!

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
I am not an effect! You doubt my power?

<character>BENDER</character>
I do.

<info>Melllvar zaps Welshy with a bolt of lightning and he falls over.</info>

<character>WELSHY</character>
(shouting) Aye!

<info>Fry runs to him and holds him.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
(screaming) Welshy!

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<info>Ships Cargo Bay.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
This court will now hear some very sensual 
testimony from this court's ex-lover, 
Turanga Leela.

<info>Leela is already in the wheelchair.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Go  yourself.

<info>She beeps.</info>

<info>Flashback.</info>

<info>Fade to: Omega 3 Surface. The flashback continues from earlier.</info>

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Behold another power, different from 
the one you saw earlier.

<info>Melllvar floats over Nimoy's jar and gives him a body and a 
blue uniform.</info>

<character>NIMOY</character>
Hey! A body! Buff, tan. Yeah, this is 
mine alright!

<character>FRY</character>
Alright, you gas, what's the deal?

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Centuries ago, the videotaped adventures 
of the Enterprise crew rained down upon 
my planet. Over and over, I watched 
them. Especially the five with the energy 
beings. I am Melllvar! Seer of the tapes, 
knower of the episodes! Tremble before 
my encyclopaedic knowledge of Star Trek!

<character>FRY</character>
Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more 
about Star Trek than me!

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
I beg to differ.  Long have I waited 
for the one who played Spock. At last, 
we can begin.

<info>A banner reading "Welcome To Trekfest 3002" appears behind him, 
hanging from a prop.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Cool! A Star Trek convention!

<character>NIMOY</character>
Uh, Melllvar, can you give us some idea 
of how long this is going to last?

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Until time stops.

<character>LEELA</character>
What?

<character>SHATNER</character>
He can't do this!

<character>NIMOY</character>
You can't be serious!

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Now, we have a full schedule of events--

<character>BENDER</character>
Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?

<character>KOENIG</character>
Good question!

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
No, you have to stay even longer.

<info>Bender and Koenig groan.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The actors sit at a long table for autographs. Nimoy 
snores. Melllvar gets Takei's autograph and Fry stands behind 
him, nervous.</info>

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. "Melllvar" 
has three "L's".

<character>TAKEI</character>
I think I've done enough conventions 
to know how to spell "Melllvar".

<info>Time Lapse. The cast and Melllvar are standing in front of a 
backdrop having their photo taken by Bender.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Say "nerd"!

<character>ALL</character>
Nerd!

<info>Time Lapse. Shatner is on a stage spoken-wording Eminem's The 
Real Slim Shady.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
(spoken-word) I'm Slim Shady,

Yes, I'm the real Shady,

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating,

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,

Please stand up,

Please stand up.

<character>KOENIG</character>
How can you do a spoken-word version 
of a rap song?

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
He found a way.

<info>Time Lapse. Fry and Melllvar are playing "Ambassador Sarek's 
Trivia Challenge" with Leela as questionmaster. Fry has 500 points 
and Melllvar has 300.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
For one hundred quatloos: Who did the 
captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?

<info>Shatner leaps up.</info>

<character>SHATNER </character>(<character>SHOUTING</character>)
Khaaan!

<info>Fry buzzes.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Uh ... Khan?

<character>LEELA</character>
Correct.

<info>Fry's score goes up to 600.</info>

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
My button has broken. The trivia contest 
has ended. I-I now have a surprise. 
You will perform a fan script, written 
by the ultimate Trek fan.

<character>FRY</character>
You have my fan script?

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
I meant me! Melllvar is the ultimate 
fan!

<character>FRY</character>
(smug) Oh, I was confused because the 
scoreboard says something different.

<info>Melllvar growls.</info>

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Trivia contest over! Take your scripts! 
We have limited rehearsal time. Now, 
I didn't make enough copies of the script 
so George and Walter will have to share.

<info>Takei reluctantly shares.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Uh, you probably don't want us to see 
you rehearsing, or it'll give away the 
ending.

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
That's right! The ending must not be 
ruined.

<character>LEELA</character>
We'll go wait in the ship.

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
<character>OK</character>.

<character>FRY</character>
Not 'til I get my 600 quatloos!

<info>Leela and Bender grab Fry and pull him away.</info>

<info>Ships Cockpit. The ship flies away from the planet.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned 
them there.

<character>BENDER</character>
I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about 
it.

<character>LEELA</character>
I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, 
but what are we supposed to do?

<character>FRY</character>
Well, usually on the show someone would 
come up with a complicated plan then 
explain it with a simple analogy.

<character>LEELA</character>
Hmm. If we can re-route engine power 
through the primary weapons and reconfigure 
them to Melllvar's frequency, that should 
overload his electro-quantum structure.

<character>BENDER</character>
Like putting too much air in a balloon!

<character>FRY</character>
Of course! It's so simple!

<info>The ship turns around and heads back to the planet.</info>

<info>Omega 3 Surface. The cast are on the set of the Enterprise bridge 
rehearsing with their scripts.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
(reading) Alas, my ship, whom I love 
like a woman, is .. .disabled.  Oh, 
Lord!

<character>NIMOY</character>
(reading) Fascinating, captain, and 
logical too. Yet we need some help.

<character>TAKEI</character>
(reading) Look, captain, Melllvar will 
help us.

<info>He turns around and points to the door. It eventually opens 
and Melllvar floats through.</info>

<character>KOENIG</character>
(reading) Keptin, I wope he will welp 
our ... vessel.

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Wessel!  You're not acting hard enough!

<character>NIMOY</character>
Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. 
When I directed Star Trek IV I got a 
magnificent performance out of Bill 
because I respected him so much.

<character>SHATNER</character>
And when I directed Star Trek V I got 
a magnificent performance out of me, 
because I respected me so much!

<info>The other actors roll their eyes.</info>

<info>Ships Jeffries Tube. Bender welds something in the Planet Express 
ships equivalent to Scotty's tube.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) OK! I'm done re-kafoobling 
the energy motron ... or, whatever.

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Fire!

<info>She pauses then presses the "<character>FIRE</character>!" button on the control panel 
herself.</info>

<info>Orange phaser beams diverge from the ship.</info>

<info>Cut to: Omega 3 Surface. The fan script performance continues.</info>

<character>NICHOLS</character>
(reading) My, what a handsome energy 
creature you are. I love you.  Hey, 
you wrote it!

<info>Melllvar grows in size and the actors step backwards.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. The ship shakes. Fry gets the obligatory 
console exploding in his face like in Star Trek. Smoke comes 
out of machinery and sparks fly.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Its not working! He's drawing straight 
from our weapons.

<character>FRY</character>
Like a balloon and ... something bad 
happens.

<info>Melllvar turns into a giant green hand � la Apollo in the Star 
Trek episode Who Mourns For Adonis?.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Fry and Leela scream.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Ship. The ship backs away. The hand grabs and 
pulls it back down to the planet.</info>

<info>Cut to: Omega 3 Surface. The ship crashes and the engine falls 
off. The crew crawl out from underneath.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Yup!

<info>Melllvar and the Star Trek actors are nearby.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
So, uh, how's rehearsal going?

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Lousy. Here I've been admiring a bunch 
of actors while you, a crew of genuine 
space heroes, risked your lives to save 
them.

<character>NIMOY</character>
Hey! We've done heroic things too.

<character>NICHOLS</character>
Yeah! In the third season I kissed Shatner!

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Silence! My whole world has turned upside-down. 
I have but one option.

<character>KOENIG</character>
Keep them and let us go?

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
No! To determine who is more worthy 
of my fanatical devotion I shall pit 
you together against each other in armed 
combat ... To the death!

<info>Everyone gasps.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Where'd you get an idiotic idea like 
that?

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Episodes 19, 46, 56 and 77.

<character>FRY</character>
Great list. Except, you forgot episode 
66!

<info>He chuckles.</info>

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
I was getting to that one!

<info>He zaps Welshy's corpse and it explodes.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<info>Ships Cargo Bay.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
So Melllvar ordered a battle to the 
death. I assume no one survived.

<info>Leela sighs.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Can we get on with this? My foot's getting 
tired!

<info>Flashback.</info>

<info>Fade to: Omega 3 Surface.</info>

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
This will be your standard battle to 
the death. The only weapons: Whatever 
you can find. But I warn you, do nothing 
until I have signalled the start of 
combat. OK, start.

<info>The Star Trek cast and Planet Express crew run off in different 
directions.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The actors hide behind a covered wagon on a Western 
set. A tumbleweed blows by. Shatner rips his shirt.</info>

<character>KOENIG</character>
I don't have much experience at fighting-- 
Except with you guys.

<character>SHATNER</character>
I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode 
where I threw my shoe at the enemy?

<character>NIMOY</character>
You mean Doohan?

<info>They both laugh and high five.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
Whoever it was, I did it like this.

<info>He takes a boot off and throws it at Takei's face.</info>

<character>TAKEI</character>
Ow!

<info>Shatner hops.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
My foot's cold!

<info>By the "Guardian of Forever" prop, Leela drops a pile of sticks 
next to Fry.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
There, we can make these into spears.

<character>FRY</character>
And we can tie these caterpillars together 
to make bow strings for bows and arrows.

<character>BENDER</character>
And we can use this machine gun to shoot 
them! Yee-haw!  That was fun!

<info>On a rock-face, the actors separate. Shatner, Nichols and Takei 
remain. Shatner holds a bamboo stick.</info>

<character>NICHOLS</character>
What if I distract them with my famous 
fan dance?

<character>SHATNER</character>
Oh, that's good, good, good, good. And 
then, George, you give them a karate 
chop!

<character>TAKEI</character>
I find that offensive. Just because 
I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume 
I know karate. Have I ever led you to 
believe I've studied karate?

<character>SHATNER</character>
Well, no, but you never talk about yourself.

<character>TAKEI</character>
(sadly) Maybe if you showed a little 
interest.

<info>Elsewhere, Fry tries out his bow and arrow.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Well, here goes nothing.

<info>He tries to fire the arrow but the bow breaks and the caterpillars 
crawl all over his face. He falls over. Nichols appears from 
behind some rocks and does the fan dance from Star Trek V.</info>

<character>NICHOLS</character>
(sexfully) Hello, boys!

<info>She dances. Bender zooms in.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoa!

<info>Takei sneaks up behind him and chops him on the shoulder.</info>

<character>TAKEI</character>
Hi-yah!

<info>Bender screams. On a cliff, Leela and Shatner edge their way 
around a rock, facing opposite directions. They bump into each 
other and turn around. Leela screams and Shatner gasps.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
There's no right way to hit a woman.

<character>LEELA</character>
Then do it the wrong way.

<character>SHATNER</character>
Fine. Yah!

<info>He kicks her and knocks her down. She gets back up.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!

<info>She does a roundhouse on him and hits him in the eye. He groans 
and raises his fists, ready to hit her.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
See you in h--

<info>Leela hits him in the face. He hits back and she dodges his 
punch and kicks him in the chest. He flies back and hits the 
ground. She jumps on him and repeatedly hits him in the face. 
Fry fights DeForest Kelley while Bender takes on Nimoy, Koenig 
and Takei.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Come on, Walter!

<character>NIMOY</character>
Take that!

<info>He hits Bender with a stick. Fry pushes Kelley away and Nichols 
cartwheels onto him, yelling. She locks his head between her 
thighs and pulls his hair.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
It hurts!

<character>NIMOY</character>
Let's see if this actually works!  Hm. 
Ow! Ow! Ow!

<character>KOENIG</character>
My face!

<character>TAKEI</character>
Ow! My face too!

<info>Shatner and Leela are both down. Shatner gets up and offers 
her his hand.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
May I?  Oh!

<info>She picks up a rock and holds it over him.</info>

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Excellent! Excellent!

<info>Shatner holds out his hand.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
Leela, please. This is exactly what 
Melllvar wants. We're just pawns in 
his diabolical game of checkers. Can't 
we resolve our differences some other 
way?

<info>A bigger pink energy cloud wearing ugly glasses appears next 
to Melllvar.</info>

<character>MELLLVAR</character>'S <character>MOTHER</character>
Melllvar! Dinner time!

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Aw, but Mom, I'm playing with my collectables!

<character>MELLLVAR</character>'S <character>MOTHER</character>
Now!

<info>Melllvar groans and disappears.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
All this time we thought he was a powerful 
super-being, yet he was just a child.

<character>MELLLVARS</character>'S <character>MOTHER</character>
He's not a child, he's 34!

<info>She disappears.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this 
for years!

<info>He grabs him by his shirt and holds up his fist. Fry grabs his 
arm.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Bender, wait! This is our chance to 
escape, before Melllvar comes back. 
But we all need to work together.

<info>Time Lapse. They run onto the cliff and find Leela and Shatner 
making out. Shatner rubs Leela's back.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
I love you so much!

<info>Nimoy clears his throat.</info>

<character>NIMOY</character>
Hello?

<info>They both look up.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
We've decided to work together.

<character>NIMOY</character>
Uh, so did they.

<info>Shatner gets up and elbows Nimoy.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
Now, how do we escape?

<character>LEELA</character>
We can't use our ship; We have life 
support but the engines are wrecked.

<character>TAKEI</character>
Ironic Because our engines work but 
our life support systems don't.

<character>LEELA</character>
Hey, if your engines work--

<character>TAKEI</character>
And your life support systems work--

<character>FRY</character>
Stop! You're just goin' around in circles! 
(to himself) Think, Fry, think! Everyone's 
depending on you.

<info>Time Lapse: Takei and Leela finish welding warp nacelles onto 
the hull of the Planet Express ship.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The ship takes off but stalls and falls.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
We're too heavy. You guys need to lose 
some weight, fast!

<info>Cut to: Omega 3 Surface. The side door of the ship opens and 
the decapitated bodies of the Star Trek cast are thrown out.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. The actors heads are in jars. Fry wheels 
in the video case.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Look, Leonard, we're light enough to 
keep the tapes! Isn't that great?

<character>NIMOY</character>
I'm living in a gefilte fish jar.

<info>The ship flies away from the planet.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
We did it!

<info>Everyone cheers.</info>

<info>Behind the ship, another ship de-cloaks. There is the sound 
of Melllvar laughing and the ship shoots at the Planet Express 
ship.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Melllvar's got a spaceship!

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Yes, in mint condition. And you made 
me take it out of the package!

<info>He shoots at them some more. The ship approaches a familiar 
ship.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
The Nimbus! We're saved!

<info>A screen comes down from above Leela's head.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
You're under arrest. Prepare to be 
boarded.

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<info>Ships Cargo Bay.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
So I boarded you, eh. What happened 
next?

<character>LEELA</character>
You started this stupid court martial. 
Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting 
Melllvar!

<info>Melllvar strafes the ship.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Everyone runs in.</info>

<info>Leela turns the ship around, back the way they came. Melllvar 
follows, shooting more.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Everyone falls over.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
One more hit and we're done for!

<character>TAKEI</character>
Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys 
have a self-destruct code? Like "destruct 
sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--"

<info>Bender's head explodes, leaving some wires, coils and his mouth 
poking out of his body.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
If I can't have the original cast of 
Star Trek, no one will! Prepare to die!

<character>FRY</character>
Wait! If they mean that much to you, 
why do you wanna kill them?

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Because I ... I ... I dunno what I'd 
do without them.

<character>FRY</character>
Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be 
your whole life. You can do anything 
you want. Look at Walter Koenig: After 
Star Trek, he became an actor.

<character>KOENIG</character>
Not just an actor, but a well-rounded 
person, with my own friends and credit 
cards and keys.

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
Well, I guess I could move out of my 
parents' basement ... maybe get a temp 
job.

<character>FRY</character>
Whoa, whoa! One step at a time.

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
I thank you, Fry. You know, you and 
I are of a kind. In a different reality 
I could have called you "friend".

<character>FRY</character>
Episode 10, Balance Of Terror.

<character>MELLLVAR</character>
More like episode nine, loser! In your 
face! Victory is mine!

<info>He turns his ship around and flies away, laughing.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cokpit. Everyone watches him return to the planet</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
I wonder, my friends, was he really 
such an evil energy gas?

<character>NICHOLS</character>
He did give us eternal youth.

<character>KOENIG</character>
24-hour Laundromat.

<character>TAKEI</character>
A full assortment of rum, both spiced 
and regular.

<character>NIMOY</character>
Truly, it was a paradise.

<character>FRY</character>
And all you had to put up with was one 
really annoying Star Trek fan.

<info>The heads catch on.</info>

<character>SHATNER</character>
Let's get the hell outta here!

<info>The ship flies away like at the end of every Star Trek episode.</info>

[Closing Credits. A pseudo-Star Trek theme plays over stills 
from the episode. An additional shot of Kif comes up, parodying 
the shot from the Star Trek episode The Corbomite Manoeuver.</xml>
