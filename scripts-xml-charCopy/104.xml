<info>Restaurant. Leela is sat at a table with a date, a man called 
Doug.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
This place was a great choice. The food 
is amazing. And such generous portions.

<character>DOUG</character>
You like the meal just wait until you 
try these after dinner mints.

<character>LEELA</character>
You know, Doug, most guys are put off 
by my eye. It's nice to finally meet 
someone who's open-minded.  Ew!

<info>Opening Credits. Caption: presented in BC [Brain Control</info> where 
available.]

<info>Planet Express: Kitchen. Amy, Leela and Fry stand around drinking 
coffee.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
What was wrong with your date last night?

<character>LEELA</character>
I don't know. Something I couldnï¿½t quite 
put my finger on. Possibly his vile 
lizard tongue.

<character>AMY</character>
You're too picky.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah. If you rule out every guy with 
a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an 
explosive violent temper, of course 
you're gonna be lonely.

<character>LEELA</character>
There's nothing wrong with having high 
standards. Now can we please stop --

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Amy, Fry and Leela walk 
in. The others are sitting around the table.</info>

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
The female Leela's problem is purely 
medical. Soon she will drop her eggs 
and they will hatch and all will be 
well.

<info>Amy, Leela and Fry sit down.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
You just have to give guys a chance. 
Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's 
a pig. But then later you realise he 
actually has a really good body.

<character>LEELA</character>
Thank you all for the inspiring advice, 
but I'm perfectly happy with my life 
the way it is.

<character>BENDER</character>
That sounds like a cry for help.

<character>AMY</character>
Let's all take her out tonight. There's 
lots of great places to meet people.

<character>HERMES</character>
The Federal Sex Bureau.

<character>BENDER</character>
A saucy puppet show.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
The rotting carcass of a whale.

<character>AMY</character>
Hmm, I'll pick!

<info>The Hip Joint. A nightclub on Jetsons-esque stilts with hovering 
platforms and strobe lighting. Everyone except Fry is wearing 
outfits with grooby rings.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
Oh, wow, it's totally retro.

<character>FRY</character>
Why's everyone wearing those rings?

<character>AMY</character>
Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! 
Rings are stupid!

<character>FRY</character>
I think they look cool.

<character>AMY</character>
Shh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!

<character>MAN</character>
Hey, did that guy just say rings are 
cool?

<character>AMY</character>
Nope, he said they're stupid.

<info>The man shows a thumbs up.</info>

<character>MAN</character>
Cool!

<info>Time Lapse. Leela, Amy and Bender are sat at a table with drinks.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
So what do you think of that guy by 
the bar?

<character>LEELA</character>
I don't know. Maybe?

<character>BENDER</character>
Forget it, he's gay.

<character>LEELA</character>
What?! How can you tell?

<character>BENDER</character>
I just know these things. I've got what 
they call gaydar.

<character>LEELA</character>
There's no such thing.

<character>BENDER</character>
No?  OK, I got a lock on him.  Yep! 
He's gay!

<character>AMY</character>
Are you sure?

<character>BENDER</character>
Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference 
from a gay weather balloon.

<info>Fry talks to a woman at the bar.</info>

<character>WOMAN</character>
You're from the 20th century? That's 
incredible! I'm from the 21st century.

<character>FRY</character>
No way! We've got so much in common.

<character>WOMAN</character>
We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs 
enslaved humanity?

<character>FRY</character>
Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.

<info>Back at the table, a well-built man has joined the others.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled 
racer with 10 wins on the pro circuit.

<character>BOLT</character>
Hello, beautiful!

<character>BENDER</character>
(whispering) I think she means 10 wins 
on the gay circuit.

<info>Bolt chuckles.</info>

<character>BOLT</character>
I wish! Those cats can really fly.

<info>Zoidberg is sitting alone at the bar. He tries to pick up a 
drink but his claws just knock the glass over. He folds his arms 
and sulks. A lobster in a tank catches his eye and he stares 
and smiles, lovestruck. At the table, a green cloud is hovering 
where Bolt was.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
This is M-5438, an entity of pure energy.

<character>LEELA</character>
That's great - really - but he's just 
not what I'm looking for.

M-5438
I understand. One day you will evolve 
beyond your physical body, and on that 
day I hope you will pick up the phone.

<info>He flies away. Amy sighs.</info>

<character>AMY</character>
You're impossible.

<info>Bender's gaydar beeps.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Just as well; I think he comes from 
a dimension that's big on musical theatre.

<info>Outside The Hip Joint. Everyone is leaving: Amy with M-5438, 
Zoidberg with the lobster and Fry with the 21st century woman. 
Bender is already outside.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Psst, I need the apartment tonight. 
Go see a saucy puppet show.

<info>He hands Bender some cash.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Can do!

<info>The Hip Joint. Leela is the only person left in the room. A 
janitor passes by her table, sweeping.</info>

<character>JANITOR</character>
My, my, my! What's a beautiful lady 
like you --  Oh, my! Eurgh! I'm sorry, 
I thought you had two eyes.

<info>He runs off.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. It's the next morning and everyone 
is sat around the table drinking coffee.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
So, Leela, you must have had your pick 
of the litter last night at closing 
time.

<character>LEELA</character>
Could you guys please stop talking about 
my personal life?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal 
life later. But right now we have business 
to attend to.

<character>FRY</character>
A delivery?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.

<info>He flicks a switch, the lights dim and a holographic image of 
a planet is projected over the table.</info>

<character>COMPUTER VOICE</character>
This is Vergon 6.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
This is Vergon 6.

<character>AMY</character>
Buh!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited 
by a number of frisky little doomed 
animals.

<character>LEELA</character>
Animals?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
That's right. Animals in desperate need 
of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once 
filled with a super dense substance 
known as dark matter, each pound of 
which weighs over ten thousand pounds.

<info>The holographic Vergon 6 is filled with a black sphere.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Wait! What about the animals?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Well, dark matter is extremely valuable 
as starship fuel. That's why it was 
all mined out, leaving the planet completely 
hollow.

<info>The holographic dark matter dwindles to nothing.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Yes, but what about the animals?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
The wha?

<character>LEELA</character>
The animals.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I didn't say anything about animals. 
Now it seems that the planet will collapse 
within three days. Incidentally, this 
will kill all the animals.

<character>LEELA</character>
So we have to bring back two of each 
kind. Just like Noah's Ark.

<character>BENDER</character>
Why two?  Oh!

<info>He giggles.</info>

<info>Ships Cockpit. The ship is en route to the planet. Bender and 
Fry lean across the cockpit discussing things.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I bet you Leela's holding out for a 
nice guy with one eye.

<character>BENDER</character>
That'll take forever. What she oughta 
do is find a nice guy with two eyes, 
then poke one out.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.

<info>Leela is sat right behind them.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Do you mind?

<character>BENDER</character>
Here you go.  You can use this as an 
eye-poker.

<character>LEELA</character>
Thank you. But I don't care how many 
eyes a man has - as long as it's less 
than five. All I'm looking for is a 
guy who's adventurous, self-confident...

<info>Cut to: Outside Ship. The ship flies on.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
...maybe a snappy dresser.

<info>As the ship flies away a larger ship - the Nimbus - flies over 
the top.</info>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge. The captain - Zapp Brannigan - stands 
admiring himself while his first officer Kif seems to do all 
the work. They both wear red uniforms. Kif is a spindly little 
green alien and Zapp's physique is mostly made up of a huge, 
poorly contained gut.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
These new uniforms are pretty snappy, 
eh, first officer?

<character>KIF</character>
I suppose, captain. I'm as big a fan 
of velour as you are. Now what do you 
want to do about that unidentified ship?

<info>The Planet Express ship flies across the viewscreen.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Destroy them!  Mmm! That's got a nice 
feel to it.

<info>Time Lapse.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Captain's journal; star date 3000.3.

<character>KIF</character>
Who are you talking to, sir?

<character>ZAPP</character>
You! Aren't you getting this?  We have 
detected a vessel attempting to break 
the security cordon around Vergon 6. 
I'm anticipating an all-out tactical 
dogfight, followed by a light dinner...ravioli, 
ham, sundae bar.

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. The crew can see the Nimbus through the 
windscreen.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.

<character>FRY</character>
Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?

<character>LEELA</character>
Uh-huh!

<character>FRY</character>
Who's the Zapp Brannigan?

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge. Zapp and Kif watch the ship approach.</info>

<character>KIF</character>
Shall I fire on them now, sir?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, 
you can never let your adversary see 
your pieces.  What?

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly 
saved the Octillian system from a horde 
of rampaging Killbots.

<character>FRY</character>
Wow!

<character>BENDER</character>
A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we 
can always build more Killbots!

<character>LEELA</character>
He's the most decorated captain in the 
whole Democratic Order Of Planets.

<character>FRY</character>
(teasing) Leela's got a boyfriend!

<character>LEELA</character>
No I don't. But I think we ought to 
meet with him and see if he'll help 
us rescue those animals.

<character>BENDER</character>
Well just in case you guys hit it off 
you'll wanna take this with you.

<info>He holds up the fork.</info>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<character>KIF</character>
Sir, they're headed straight for us.

<character>ZAPP</character>
A well-calculated move straight out 
of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of 
War, or my own masterwork: Zapp Brannigan's 
Big Book Of War.  But the one thing 
their captain doesn't realise and never 
will is that --

<character>KIF</character>
Sir, they've docked with us and have 
come aboard.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, 
old man, I'll be in the escape pod. 
If that wicker chair I like survives 
the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. 
box.

<info>The door opens and the Planet Express crew walk in. Zapp screams 
and hides behind a chair. Leela looks around and sees Kif.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet 
Express delivery ship. We've come aboard 
to plead for your assistance.

<character>KIF</character>
Well, if there's anything --

<info>Zapp jumps in front of Kif.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. 
Has my fame preceded me or was I too 
quick for you?

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, not at all. I'm just so uh...really 
thrilled to meet you!

<character>ZAPP</character>
You're an impressive piece of captain. 
Beautiful and deadly - a potent combination.

<character>LEELA</character>
(flattered) You don't mean that!

<character>ZAPP</character>
But I do. I doubt I've seen more than 
three or four captains sexier than you, 
and only one who was deadlier.

<info>He takes her hand and Fry leans in.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
I heard that one time you single-handedly 
defeated a horde of rampaging somethings 
in the something something system.

<character>ZAPP</character>
The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply 
a matter of outsmarting them.

<character>FRY</character>
Wow! I never would have thought of that!

<character>ZAPP</character>
You see, Killbots have a preset kill 
limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent 
wave after wave of my own men at them, 
until they reached their limit and shutdown. 
Kif, show them the medal I won.

<info>Kif sighs and points to a medal on Zapp's uniform.</info>

<info>Nimbus Mess Hall. Leela, Zapp, Fry and Bender sit at a table, 
looking down at the rest of the crew who are eating. Kif is grating 
cheese over Zapp's food.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
More, please.  A little more...more...keep 
going.

<info>He carries on.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Captain Brannigan, we really need to 
talk to you about our mission.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave 
after wave of men at your disposal. 
Right men?

<info>He raises his glass to the crew.</info>

<character>CREWMAN</character>
(shouting) You suck!

<character>LEELA</character>
We're hoping to save the animals of 
Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you 
could just --

<info>Zapp spits out his drink.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Vergon 6?! This light dinner is over.

<character>LEELA</character>
Wait! What's wrong?

<character>ZAPP</character>
The Democratic Order Of Planets prohibits 
interfering with undeveloped worlds. 
It's a little rule known as "Brannigan's 
Law".

<character>LEELA</character>
But people already interfered. That 
planet was mined completely hollow.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Yes, by a Democratic Order Of Planets 
mining crew.

<character>LEELA</character>
This doesn't make any sense.

<character>ZAPP</character>
I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's 
Law. I merely enforce it.

<character>LEELA</character>
Fine! We'll save the animals without 
your help.

<character>ZAPP</character>
I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!

<info>Guards grab Leela, Fry and Bender.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
What just happened?

<character>BENDER</character>
He's throwing us in prison.

<info>Fry sighs.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?

<info>He holds up his plate and Zapp nods.</info>

<info>Nimbus Brig. Leela touches the force field around the doorway 
and gets electrocuted.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan 
if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw 
me in prison.

<character>BENDER</character>
You really are too picky.

<info>Nimbus Corridor.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Kif, follow me up to the observation 
deck. I've got some musing to do.

<info>Zapp climbs a ladder and Kif accidentally looks up his skirt.</info>

<character>KIF</character>
Oh, jeez!

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Observation Deck.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
I'm facing a formidable female adversary, 
Kif. Suggestions?

<character>KIF</character>
I fail to see any problem sir. You already 
imprisoned her under directive B10.81.

<character>ZAPP</character>
You mean Brannigan's Law?

<character>KIF</character>
Right, that law.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Which one?

<info>Kif sighs.</info>

<character>KIF</character>
Brannigan's Law.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend 
but you've earned my contempt once again. 
As my prodï¿½gï¿½ you should know that the 
only way to deal with a female adversary 
is to seduce her.  This time we are 
sure she's a woman, right?

<character>KIF</character>
Yes.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Good! Invite her to my quarters. Oh, 
and have the boy lay out my formal shorts.

<character>KIF</character>
The boy, sir?

<character>ZAPP</character>
You. You lay out my formal shorts.

<info>He disappears down the ladder.</info>

<info>Nimbus Corridor. Kif walks past crewmembers with Leela following 
him.</info>

<character>KIF</character>
The jackass wants to see you in his 
quarters.

<character>LEELA</character>
Good. This will be my chance to reason 
with him, captain to captain.

<character>KIF</character>
And he wants you to wear this.

<info>Kif holds up a skimpy little outfit. Leela ignores it and knocks 
on Zapp's door.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Come and get it!

<info>Cut to: Zapp's Quarters. The doors open and Leela walks in. 
The room is filled with candles and other crap. Zapp lies on 
his hovering heart-shaped bed under a huge portrait of himself 
that is similar to the portrait of <character>JFK</character>.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Welcome to my humble chamber. Or as 
I call it, "the Love-nasium". Shampagin?

<character>LEELA</character>
I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Well I have studied abroad. Or two!

<info>He laughs. Leela fakes a laugh and throws her champagne on the 
floor while Zapp isn't looking.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Captain...

<character>ZAPP</character>
Uh-huh?

<character>LEELA</character>
...if we could speak seriously for a 
moment...

<character>ZAPP</character>
Uh-huh?

<character>LEELA</character>
...I'd like you to reconsider letting 
us rescue those animals.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Mm-hm.  I like your style. I find it 
very...(whispering)...erotic.

<character>LEELA</character>
What?

<character>ZAPP</character>
(shouting) Erotic!

<info>Cut to: Kif's Quarters. Zapp's words echo around the ship. Kif 
gets frustrated and bangs the ceiling with a broom handle.</info>

<info>Nimbus Brig. Fry and Bender are still inside.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
We can definitely escape, Bender. All 
you have to do is bend the hatch off 
this steam pipe.

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, yeah!

<info>He bends the hatch off and the steam rushes out of it and starts 
filling the room.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
No good! It's full of steam!

<info>Zapp's Quarters. Leela impatiently paces back and forth.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
You look like a woman who enjoys the 
finer things. Come over here and feel 
my velour bedspread.

<character>LEELA</character>
I'm not really in the mood.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself 
go.

<info>He rolls over onto his back.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Can I please just go back to prison?

<character>ZAPP</character>
You'd rather sit in prison than spend 
one evening with the Zapper?

<character>LEELA</character>
Much rather!  What are you doing?

<character>ZAPP</character>
(crying) Oh, God, I'm pathetic. Sorry. 
Just go. You want the rest of the shampagin?

<character>LEELA</character>
No, and it's pronounced "sham-pane".

<character>ZAPP</character>
(crying) Oh, God, no!

<character>LEELA</character>
Its not a big deal.

<character>ZAPP</character>
(crying) I get so lonely. I just thought 
you - a fellow captain - would understand.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, forget it.

<character>ZAPP</character>
(crying) Yeah, it's great ordering people 
around and stuff but through it all 
you're completely alone.

<character>LEELA</character>
It comes with the job.

<character>ZAPP</character>
(crying) I'm just so lonely!

<info>He cries more.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, come on, cheer up, it's not that 
bad.

<info>Nimbus Brig. The room is still full of steam.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
You wanna try escaping again?

<character>BENDER</character>
Nah, I'm comfy.

<info>They are wearing towels enjoying the steam room they've created.

<character>FRY</character>
Man, Leela's been gone a long time. 
I hope she's at least making progress 
with Zapp Brannigan.

[Cut to: Zapp's Quarters. The morning after the night before... 
Leela wakes up. She turns her head and sees she's lying in Zapp's 
bed. With him. He is still asleep and has a big grin on his face. 
She screams.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela has got dressed and is sneaking out. Zapp 
wakes up.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Good morning, lover.

<character>LEELA</character>
Uh, listen, Zapp.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! 
I can't say I don't envy you.

<character>LEELA</character>
Zapp, last night was a mistake.

<character>ZAPP</character>
A sexy mistake.

<character>LEELA</character>
No, just a regular mistake. For a split 
second my common sense was overwhelmed 
by pity.

<info>Zapp laughs.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
A split second is all it takes. That's 
why sooner or later you'll come crawling 
back to the Zapper.

<character>LEELA</character>
The only kind of crawling I'm doing 
to you is away - from!

<character>ZAPP</character>
Leela, you're obviously confused and 
aroused.

<character>LEELA</character>
Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to 
save those animals whether you like 
it or not.

<character>ZAPP</character>
Go ahead. I won't stop you.

<character>LEELA</character>
Threaten all you -- wait, what?

<character>ZAPP</character>
We both know you won't make it halfway 
to Vergon 6 before the craving sets 
in. Then you'll come crawling back for 
another taste of sweet, sweet candy...Bam!

<info>He points at his crotch.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Eurgh!

<info>She storms out. Zapp chuckles.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Kif!

<info>Kif appears in the doorway.</info>

<character>KIF</character>
Yes --  Yes, captain?

<character>ZAPP</character>
I have made it with a woman. Inform 
the men.

<info>Nimbus Brig. Kif lets Fry and Bender out of the cell.</info>

<character>KIF</character>
The fatso says you're free to go.

<character>FRY</character>
Really? Why?

<character>KIF</character>
(quietly) "Why" indeed.

<info>He looks at Leela then walks off.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
What does that mean?

<character>LEELA</character>
(defensively) Nothing.

<character>BENDER</character>
So should we get our stuff and head 
down to the planet?

<character>LEELA</character>
(defensively) We just talked, OK?!

<info>The ship flies down to Vergon 6, through the green cloudy sky. 
The planet is surreal and Dali-like.</info>

<info>Vergon 6 Surface. Leela, Fry and Bender stand beside the ship 
with huge nets.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Alright. We don't have much time to 
collect these animals. The planet is 
supposed to collapse in approximately 
two hours ago.

<info>Montage The crew hunt for the animals. First, Bender tries to 
find the purple fruit snake but it finds him first and eats him. 
He stands up inside the snake and drags it back to the ship. 
Fry tries to get the windy shrimp but it blows him away. Leela 
tries to get the four legged mimic which looks like a horse but 
copies people's heads and movements. Fry holds a net and tries 
to decide which one is the mimic. Leela points at the mimic and 
it points back at her. Fry looks...and throws the net over Leela. 
Later, Leela ticks off the final animal on the checklist.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The checklist is filled. A small animal comes out 
from behind some plants. It is mostly black, has one huge nostril 
in the middle of its face and a three eyes, one of them on a 
long stalk coming out of the middle of it's head.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Hello there.  Hmm, he doesn't seem to 
be on the checklist.

<character>BENDER</character>
So you're saying we can cook him?

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious 
apron.

<character>LEELA</character>
No! I don't care how hilarious your 
apron is, we're not cooking him.  Aww, 
I'll call him Nibbler.

<character>BENDER</character>
Aww! (whispering to Fry) I'll fire up 
the grill!

<info>Time Lapse.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
I hope he'll be OK in there with all 
those big animals.

<info>Ships Cargo Bay. Leela opens the outer door, puts him in and 
closes it. The other animals surround Nibbler. He sniffs at them 
and then eats one whole.</info>

<info>Nimbus Observation Deck. Zapp is looking at Leela through a 
telescope.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I 
won't have much time to hang out with 
the boys anymore.

<character>KIF</character>
That's a shame, sir.

<character>ZAPP</character>
So let's make the most of our time together, 
shall we?  Never mind. Just give me 
a back rub.

<info>Vergon 6 Surface. Bender carries a two-headed flamingo.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
I found a pair of Hermaphlamingoes.

<character>LEELA</character>
Good. That's the last species.

<info>Ships Cargo Bay. The crew look inside and gasp in horror. The 
bay is nearly empty apart from Nibbler.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey. What the?

<character>FRY</character>
Where'd they all go?

<info>Nibbler eats the Hermaphlamingoes, making lots of disgusting 
noises. The crew watch and cringe.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Nibbler!

<character>FRY</character>
I can't believe we flew halfway across 
the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just 
to get lunch for that stupid animal!

<character>BENDER</character>
He's pending for a bending.

<info>He rolls up his sleeves and chases Nibbler. He runs to Leela 
and she picks him up.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Leave him alone. It's not his fault 
that he's an unstoppable killing machine. 
Is it, snoogums?

<info>The ground shakes, rocking the ship.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
The planet's kerploding!

<info>Cut to: Vergon 6 Surface. Fry runs out through a door and falls 
through the ground. Bender reaches into the hole and pulls him 
back up.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Prepare for lift-off.  We're out of 
fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the 
tank before we left.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.

<info>The ground shakes again.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.

<character>LEELA</character>
No way, forget it! I refuse to go crawling 
back to him!

<character>FRY</character>
What? What are you talking about?

<character>LEELA</character>
(defensively) Nothing. We just talked.

<character>BENDER</character>
So what's your problem? It's not like 
you slept with him.  Oh, my God!

<character>FRY</character>
How could you, Leela? I thought you 
had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's 
a dumb, gross gorilla!

<character>LEELA</character>
That's enough. Don't you think I feel 
bad enough already?

<character>FRY</character>
No!

<info>The ground shakes more violently.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Alright, alright I'll call him.  I mean 
if living is that important to you.

<info>Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
And that's why you'll never make captain, 
Kif.  Hmmm.

<info>Leela face appears.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Hello, Zapp?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Well, well, well!

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Zapp, we're out of fuel...

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. 
We need your help.

<character>ZAPP</character>
So, crawling back to the Big Z like 
a bird on its belly. Delicious.

<character>LEELA</character>
Bird's don't crawl.

<character>ZAPP</character>
They've been known to.

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
Look, are you going to rescue us or 
not?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Can't you ask a little more...sexfully?

<info>Fry and Bender encourage Leela.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
(sexfully) Please...

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
...Big Z?

<character>ZAPP</character>
Certainly. But first you'll have to 
get rid of that thing.  That's the law, 
Leela. And Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's 
love: hard and fast!...

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
...Now put that greasy rat outside 
and we'll tow you to safety.

<character>LEELA</character>
I would never abandon a helpless animal. 
Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were 
a big pompous buffoon. Then I realised 
that inside you were just a pitiful 
child. But now I realise that outside 
that child is a big pompous buffoon!

<character>ZAPP</character>
And which one rocked your world?

<info>Leela growls and slams down the receiver and his face fizzles 
off the screen.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Wow, way to tell that guy off. Now what's 
your secret escape plan?

<character>LEELA</character>
Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for 
death.

<character>BENDER</character>
Can do!

<info>He puts his feet up and reclines in his chair. There is a huge 
bang and the ship jerks backwards.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
What the hell was that?

<info>Ships Cargo Bay. There is a big round black blob in Nibbler's 
litter tray.</info>

<character>FRY</character>
Pew!

<info>He fans the air in front of his nose.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
I don't believe it! It's dark matter.

<character>BENDER</character>
So this guy just unloaded a steaming 
pile of starship fuel?

<character>LEELA</character>
His species must've filled the entire 
planet with it. Did you do that, you 
cute little --  Come on. That should 
be more than enough fuel to get us outta 
here. Bender, pick it up and put it 
in the engine.

<info>Bender mutters to himself and drags the dark matter across the 
floor towards the engine room.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Engine Room. Bender throws the dark matter into 
the boiler.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. The fuel gauge fills up, Leela throttles 
forward and the ship lifts off, moments before the ground collapses. 
They fly away from the planet and it explodes. The crew cheer.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
We made it!  And some of the animals 
survived.

<info>She looks through the binoculars and sees some animals standing 
on a tiny fragment of rock.</info>

<character>BENDER</character>
So a couple of animals didn't die and 
Leela got lucky. That's what I call 
a successful mission!

<character>FRY</character>
We're heroes!

<info>Leela's Quarters. Leela writes in her diary. Nibbler is on her 
lap and she is stroking him.</info>

<character>LEELA</character>
(thinking) Dear Captain's Diary. I may 
not have found love on this mission 
but I did find a cute little companion 
who excretes starship fuel. And that's 
just as good.

<info>She pauses for a moment then tears the page out, screws it up 
and throws it in the bin.</info>

<info>Outside Nimbus.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
Captain's journal; star date...uh...

<info>Kif sighs.</info>

<character>KIF</character>
April 13th.

<character>ZAPP</character>
April 13th...point two.

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<character>ZAPP</character>
We have failed to uphold Brannigan's 
Law. However, I did make it with a hot 
alien babe. And in the end is that not 
what man has dreamt of since first he 
looked up at the stars? Kif, I'm asking 
you a question!

<info>Kif sighs.</info>
