                         It's very simple. The ad gets into your 
                         brain just like this liquid gets into 
                         this egg.  Although in reality it's 
                         not liquid, but gamma radiation.

                         Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only

                          Call me old fashioned, but when my 
                         robot starts to squeak like an old screen 
                         door well, that's when I reach for a 
                         can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil.

                         still on your body, and you want a cheese

                          That's why these anchovies are going 
                         on a pizza, so I can share the food 
                         I love with the people I like.

                         Holy hell! You're going to eat them? 
                         Oh, well. Just make sure you eat them 
                         all. You're a growing boy. Toodle-oo! 
                          Dumb ass!
