                         Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll 
                         be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the 
                         virus planet.

                         I want all of you to be alive. It's

                         Every member presents an invention and 
                         the best one wins the Academy prize.

                         Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because 
                         my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! 
                         The death clock.  Simply jam your finger 
                         in the hole and this readout tells you 
                         exactly how long you have left to live.

                         Now, we all know telescopes allow us 
                         to see distant objects. But what if 
                         we want to smell distant objects? Well 
                         now we can! Thanks to my new invention...the 
                         Smellescope.

                          New York City: the year 2000. The most 
                         wasteful society in the history of the 
                         galaxy and it was running out of places 
                         to empty its never-ending output of 
                         garbage.  The landfills were full. New 
                         Jersey was full. And so, under cover 
                         of darkness, the city put its garbage 
                         out to sea on the world's largest barge. 
                          The repulsive barge circled the oceans 
                         for 50 years but no country would accept 
                         it. Not even that really filthy one. 
                         You know the one I mean. Finally, in 
                         2052, the city used its mob connections 
                         to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage 
                         into outer space. Some experts claim 
                         the ball might return to Earth someday,

                         the 20th century. We gave the world 
                         the lightbulb, the steamboat and the 
                         cotton gin.

                         up there. Also, one month my toilet

                         If my calculations are correct, this 
                         garbage ball will knock the other garbage 
                         ball directly into the sun.
