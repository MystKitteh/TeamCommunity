[Opening Credits. Caption: A Stern Warning of Things to Come.]

[Planet Express: Lounge. Nibbler sits on Leela's lap and she 
picks tufts out of his fur. Bender does the same to Fry. Enter 
Hermes.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Exciting news, people! The pet licence 
I requsitioned for Nibbler has arrived.

<character>LEELA</character>
Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know 
you cared about Nibbler.

<character>HERMES</character>
Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the 
little bastard in a sack and toss the 
sack in a river and hurl the river into 
space. But I do like filling out requisitions 
and these were some doozies!  Great 
Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. 
This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing 
licence. And it's mandatory!

[The Planet Express ship takes off and heads out to sea. It stops 
a short while later and the cargo bay lift comes down with Bender, 
Fry and Farnsworth standing on it.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic 
Ocean. This seems the logical place 
for fish to congregate.

<character>BENDER</character>
So we're in international waters?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Indeed so.

[Bender whips out a radio and talks into it.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose 
has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested. 
Hey, guess what you're accessories 
to?

[Time Lapse. On the roof of the ship, the crew pull out their 
fishing equipment from the gun turret.]

<character>LEELA</character>
The sun, the sea air, good friends.

<character>BENDER</character>
Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya 
say we make it interesting?

<character>HERMES</character>
Why not?

<character>AMY</character>
Yeah.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yeah, cool.

<character>BENDER</character>
Everybody kick in five bucks.  There, 
wasn't that interesting?

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender!

[Fry chuckles.]

<character>FRY</character>
This contest is as good as over. I once 
caught a fish this big.

[He stretches out his arms.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this 
big!

[He extends his arms the length of the ship. Leela opens a case.]

<character>LEELA</character>
I'm afraid you're both out of your league, 
boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman 
who owns her own harpoon.

[She twists the top of the harpoon onto the bottom.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Harpoon, my ass!

<character>LEELA</character>
<character>OK</character>.

[And she does. He screams in pain and jumps into the water. Hermes 
looks at five buckets.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Let's see now, which bait to use?  Crickets? 
Squid? Chicken necks?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm 
willing to offer my services as a bait 
critic.  These sardines for example 
are bland and tasteless.  And these 
dry, stringy nightcrawlers, though juicy 
...  ... very very juicy--

[He sticks his head in the bucket and gobbles the bait.]

<character>HERMES</character>
I don't believe this! It's eating my 
bait!  Beat it, you mooching crawdad!

[Zoidberg runs away and woops. Bender presses a button on his 
fishing rod.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided 
fishing rod.

<character>FRY</character>
(whispering) Quiet, Bender, you're scaring 
away the fish.

<character>BENDER</character>
Fine. I'll head over to the other side. 
(shouting) Good luck fishing on this 
side!

[He walks away and Fry casts his line and chuckles.]

<character>FRY</character>
I can hit a fish between the eyes from 
20 yards!

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!

<character>FRY</character>
A shrimp?  I find it a bit hard to believe 
that--

[Bender's line hits Fry between the eyes and knocks him over. 
Leela spins her harpoon around and sees something in the water.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Aha!  Gather round, chumps! I got the 
winner!

[An old boot comes out of the water on the end of the harpoon. 
Leela sighs.]

<character>AMY</character>
Oh, so this is where you shop for your 
boots?

[Fry reels in a little fish.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Couple more of those and you'll have 
yourself a fish stick!

[He laughs.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish 
nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's 
bigger than anything you've caught. 
Ow! My small intestine!

[Leela tries again with the harpoon.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times 
heavier than a boot.

[She pulls out a crate marked "Boots 10 Pair" and sighs.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
You'll never catch anything with that 
primitive technology. What you need 
is this fish pheromone.  The most potent 
aphrodisiac known to fishkind.  Uh-oh!

[Several fish leap up to his head. He screams and knocks them 
off. Zoidberg comes up behind him and sniffs him.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(sexfully) I'm so into you!

[He wraps his mouth flaps around Farnsworth's head and slurps.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh, my!

[Fry reels in his line. There is big fish attached to it.]

<character>FRY</character>
(shouting) Hey, Bender, I just caught 
a fish this big!

<character>BENDER</character>
Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! 
If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might 
as well not catch a big fish.  There. 
Like most of life's problems this one 
can be solved with bending.

[He ties the ships tether line to the hook.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Bender, be careful. That's the ships 
diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.

<character>BENDER</character>
Then why do I have to be careful?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
It belonged to my grandmother.

[Bender takes some food from Hermes' hands, attaches it to his 
hook and throws it into the sea.]

<character>HERMES</character>
My manwich!

[Time Lapse. Dusk approaches. Fry is asleep in a chair with his 
rod next to him, Amy is asleep, Hermes is asleep with sign hanging 
around him saying he will be awake at 7pm. Bender snoozes, his 
door opening and closing. Leela casts her harpoon again.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Wake up, everyone! I've got something. 
And this time it's alive!  Dr. Zoidberg, 
since when do you even wear boots?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
I wasn't wearing it. (ashamed) I was 
eating it.

[Leela sighs and lets go of the rope.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Come on, let's go home.

[Amy wakes up and screams.]

<character>AMY</character>
Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! 
What happened to my parasol?

<character>BENDER</character>
I don't know. It wasn't here when I 
took your umbrella.  What? I put sunblock 
on you.

<character>AMY</character>
Well it didn't work!

[She turns around and stomps off. On her back Bender has spelled 
out "Honk If Bender Is Great" in sunblock. He giggles.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and 
let's go.

[Bender tries to pull in the line.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, I'm snagged.

[The line starts to whirr away.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
It's not snagged, the mechano man has 
caught something!  Sweet Zombie Jesus! 
It's huge!

<character>AMY</character>
It's coming up!

[A huge fish leaps up from the water and over the top of the 
ship. The staff gasp.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Oh, that's big!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
A colossal-mouth bass!

[The bass heads back under the water and the tether starts winding 
away.]

<character>FRY</character>
It's diving!

[The ship shakes and tilts forward.]

<character>LEELA</character>
It's pulling us under! Everyone into 
the ship!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable 
diamond filament!  Well, at least I'll 
die with my friends. Hello?

[The others shut the turret door behind them and the water line 
creeps towards Zoidberg. He climbs in and shuts it behind him. 
The ship lurches forward and disappears under the water and the 
staff scream. Something floats to the surface.]

<character>HERMES</character>
(from ship) My Speedos!

[Ships Cockpit. The room is glowing red and a klaxon beeps. Leela 
watches the depth gauge.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 
50 hundred! 5000 feet!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres 
of pressure.

<character>FRY</character>
How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere 
between zero and one.

[The ships hull creaks around them.]

<character>BENDER</character>
What's that? Is someone bending girders?

[More creaking. The depth gauge reaches 6000ft and breaks. Farnsworth's 
glasses break and so do Bender's eyes. He screws some new ones 
in.]

<character>LEELA</character>
We'll be crushed if we don't equalise 
the pressure.

<character>FRY</character>
How do we do that?

[Pipes burst around the room and the water floods in.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
That should do it.

[The water gets higher.]

<character>AMY</character>
We're all gonna die!

<character>FRY</character>
Wait, I'll be back in a minute.

[He takes off his jacket and swims under the water. A toilet 
flushes and the water level drops. The staff cheer and Fry walks 
back in, zipping up his shorts.]

<character>LEELA</character>
You did it, Fry!

<character>FRY</character>
Did what?

[The ship hits some rocks and everyone is thrown across the room, 
screaming. The ship comes to a rest on the ocean floor. Bender 
looks out the window.]

<character>BENDER</character>
People, it's far far worse than we thought; 
My fish got away.

[Ship Corridor. Bender fixes the electricity and the lights come 
back on, Leela mops the floor and Fry tapes up a crack in the 
hull.]

<character>LEELA</character>
There, good as new! Except we're three 
miles below the surface, we don't have 
any food and the ship won't work underwater.

<character>BENDER</character>
(restrained) Tempers are wearing thin. 
Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill 
everybody.

<character>HERMES</character>
The important thing is that we don't 
panic. There are rules for situations 
like this.  Now, the first order of 
business is lunch. I suggest a nice 
lobster Zoidberg, I mean lobster Newburg, 
I mean Doctor Zoidberg.

<character>LEELA</character>
OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor 
and I will get to work on the ship. 
Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive 
underwater, you'll go out and look for 
food.

<character>FRY</character>
I'd better go too. They don't know what 
I like.

[He opens the airlock.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Fry, no! The pressure will crush you 
like a green snake under a sugarcane 
truck.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Not necessarily. This is chance for 
Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure 
pill.

[He pulls out a huge black pill.]

<character>FRY</character>
I can't swallow that.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Well then good news! It's a suppository.

[Seabed. Fry, Bender and Zoidberg walks across the ocean floor. 
Fry holds a bag of air. Zoidberg picks up a fish and puts it 
Bender's chest cabinet.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
How are you doing there, Fry?  Glad 
to hear it.  Aha!

[He puts it in Bender's chest cabinet. Bender sees an electric 
eel and grabs it. It shocks him.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Aw, yeah!

[Zoidberg sees a little glowing thing.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Yum, yum, yum!  Uh-oh!  Look at me, 
I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!

[Time Lapse. The trio search for food next to a sunken wreck. 
Fry lifts a skull and crossbones flag.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Careful, Fry, I think that flag might 
be poisonous.

[Bender emerges from the boat wearing a pirate hat and an eyepatch 
and carrying some bottles.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty 
grub.  Arr! The laws o' science be a 
harsh mistress!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help 
me move a couch?

<character>BENDER</character>
Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs.

[He climbs into the shell leaving Fry alone. Some seaweed parts, 
revealing a mermaid. She laughs and swims away and Fry blubbers. 
Zoidberg and Bender emerge from the shell.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
What is it, Fry?

<character>FRY</character>
(blubberling) Mermaid.

<character>BENDER</character>
You want some lemonade? You saw a big 
parade?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Your student loans have been repaid? 
Then how 'bout lending your old pal 
Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr Millionaire!

[Ships Mess. The crew are eating. Fry is still blubberling.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Fry, swallow your food. Then talk.

[Fry swallows.]

<character>FRY</character>
A mermaid!

[Amy laughs.]

<character>AMY</character>
You think you saw a mermaid?

<character>FRY</character>
No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing 
a tube top and she had a beautiful scaley 
tail. And I think she had hair extensions.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah, right!

<character>LEELA</character>
Sure she did.

<character>HERMES</character>
OK, Fry!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
You're simply hallucinating, you ... 
moron.

<character>FRY</character>
What's so far-fetched about mermaids? 
I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea 
creatures here in the future. Like Dr. 
Zoidberg.

[He through the window at Zoidberg. He is wearing a sunhat and 
has built a window box on his shell and is landscaping a garden. 
He turns around and waves.]

<character>LEELA</character>
I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean 
madness.

<character>FRY</character>
Every time something good happens to 
me you say it's some kind of madness, 
or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. 
Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish 
for once my friends would have decency 
and kindness to believe me.

<character>LEELA</character>
(whispering) Ocean madness.

[Fry storms out.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
He may have ocean madness but that's 
no excuse for ocean rudeness.

[Fry's And Bender's Quarters. Fry lies awake while Bender snores.]

<character>FRY</character>
(muttering) Ocean madness, yeah right. 
It's always something, ain't it?  (talking) 
It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! 
Wake up!  Oh! oxygen!

[He picks up a suitcase.]

[Cut to: Seabed. Fry steps outside the airlock and closes the 
door behind him. His suitcase floats away and he screams. The 
mermaid puts something in his mouth.]

<character>MERMAID</character>
Here you go, darlin'.

[Fry breathes.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hey! I can breath and talk, just like 
a fish!

<character>MERMAID</character>
Oh, you speak fish?

[She says something in fish.]

<character>FRY</character>
What?

<character>MERMAID</character>
I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, 
my name's Umbriel!

<character>FRY</character>
I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
Course not. Just stay calm and let the 
currents relax your every muscle.

[Fry relaxes.]

<character>FRY</character>
Aw, yeah!

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
Did it just get warmer?

<character>FRY</character>
I can't believe you're really real. 
I like your tail.

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly 
doo-dads comin' outta your hips.

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, Thanks. They're called pants.

[Time Lapse. Fry and Umbriel sit next to a glowing vent.]

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
This here's a volcanic vent. The water 
comes out at over 4000 degrees.

<character>FRY</character>
No kidding.

[He relaxes.]

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
Did it just get colder?  Tell me more 
about that bizarre land-y world you 
come from. Is there water there too?

<character>FRY</character>
Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky.

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
Hm.

<character>FRY</character>
And sometimes it doesn't.

[She gasps.]

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!

<character>FRY</character>
You know what I like best about you, 
Umbriel? You find me fascinating even 
when I'm not claiming to be a jewel 
thief or a lion tamer.

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
Lions? There are sealions on the land?

<character>FRY</character>
Yup. We call them land-sealions ... 
I tame them!

[Montage: Fry and Umbriel date to Donovan's Atlantis. They watch 
a squid and whale fight, swim on the back of a flat fish and 
Fry spells out words to Umbriel with glowing fish. They look 
into each other's eyes and kiss.]

[Ships Galley. Bender reads The Atlantic Monthly while Leela, 
Amy and Hermes are gathered around something. Enter Farnsworth.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I'm almost finish reconfiguring the 
ships propulsion system. We can leave 
as soon as the paper-m�ch� is dry.

<character>LEELA</character>
Where's Fry?

<character>BENDER</character>
I didn't kill him. Professor?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
No, I've been busy.

<character>HERMES</character>
He must've gone out looking for that 
mermaid. The poor demented honky.

<character>LEELA</character>
It's ocean madness alright. Sailors 
call it aqua dementia, the deep down 
crazies, the wet willies, the screaming 
moist!

[As she speaks the crew leave. Bender slams the door behind him.]

[Cut to: Ship Corridor. Leela joins the rest of them. Farnsworth 
opens the door to the airlock.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
We'll form a search party. Now, we'll 
need oxygen.

<character>BENDER</character>
I got it covered.  In the event of an 
emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation 
device.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Ooh, that reminds me: You've all taken 
your pressure pills, right?

<character>AMY</character>
Yes! Stop asking!

[Seabed. The crew stand outside the ship wearing their oxygen 
masks. Zoidberg sniffs around like a dog.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
I've got his scent! Over here where 
the water gets warmer. This way!

[The staff follow him across the seabed. They peek over a mound 
and gasp. Ahead of them is a city.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(awestruck) Bend me!

[Amy says something in Chinese.]

<character>AMY</character>
Dude! An ancient sunken city!

[The crew look at a partly-obscured sign that reads "City Of 
Atl".]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Could it possibly be? Are the old legends 
true?  It is! It's the fabled lost city 
of Atlanta!

<character>MERMAN</character>
Howdy, y'all!

[City Of Atlanta. The crew are greated by another merman.]

<character>COLONEL</character>
Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these 
parts call me the Colonel.  Here, have 
some breathers, courtesy of our Chamber 
of Commerce.

[He hands them the same breathing gear Umbriel gave Fry earlier. 
They put them in.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
This is uncomfortable and humiliating. 
Now, if they could put it in the form 
of a suppository.

<character>COLONEL</character>
Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our 
main source of income round here so 
see the sights, spend some money. Please 
don't leave!

[Fry and Umbriel come out of Krispy Kreme.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still 
alive! (whispering) I owe you 10 bucks, 
Hermes!

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing 
happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at 
Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids.

<character>COLONEL</character>
Nice out of town folks, I'd like you 
to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, 
these are some Yankees.

[Time Lapse. The staff, Umbriel and the Colonel wander around 
the city.]

<character>AMY</character>
So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city 
in your time?

<character>FRY</character>
I think it was just an airport. They 
had a place where you could buy nuts.

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just 
a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, 
the equal of Paris or New York.

<character>FRY</character>
That's right, honey! Whatever you say.

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner 
Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant, 
the, uh, the airport.

<character>LEELA</character>
But tell us: How could a city with such 
a ... fabulous airport, end up underwater?

<character>COLONEL</character>
Ah, now that's a story that can only 
rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce 
video narrated by folk-rock trubadour 
Donovan.

[He presses a button and Donovan appears on the screen and strums 
the tune to Atlantis with slightly different lyrics.]

<character>DONOVAN</character>
Atlanta was a city, landlocked, hundreds 
of miles from the area we now call the 
Atlantic Ocean,

Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism that they moved 
offshore, becoming an island and an even bigger Delta hub,

[On the screen, helicopters lift the city and land it in the 
ocean. The scene changes to years later. The island is packed 
with buildings.]

Until the city over-developed and it started to sink,

Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away,

Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy, the guy who invented 
Coca-Cola, the magician and the other so-called gods of our legends,

Though gods they were -- and also Jane Fonda was there.

[A boat with the people on pulls away and the city sinks.]

The others chose to remain behind on their porches with their 
rifles, and one day evolve into mermaids, and sing and dance 
and ring in the new.

<character>MERMAIDS</character>
Hail Atlanta!

[The video ends.]

<character>LEELA</character>
The magician?

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions 
of years to evolve into mermaids?

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
Normally, yes, but the caffine really 
sped things up.  That stuff's wonderful.

[Colonel's House. The staff are seated around a dining table 
with the Colonel and Umbriel.]

<character>COLONEL</character>
So when Umbriel first brought home this 
carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, 
damnit, if old legs here ain't grown 
on me!

[He pats Fry on the back.]

<character>FRY</character>
Aw, shucks, Colonel.

[He spits tobacco and the spitoon dings.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Well, it's all very nice here but we 
should be going. I miss me wife and 
me oxygen.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yes, we all miss our loved ones and 
gases. Come on, Fry.

<character>FRY</character>
Wait. I'm not going with you.

[Everyone gasps.]

<character>LEELA</character>
But, Fry, what about us? What about 
your life on the surface? You don't 
belong down here.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
She's right, I mean sure they got the 
Braves but it's a third-rate symphony.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, 
be reasonable. Don't you realise that 
if you stay at this depth your body 
will permanently adapt to the pressure?

<character>FRY</character>
Realise it? I don't even understand 
it!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
It means you'll never be able to return 
to the surface.

<character>FRY</character>
I don't care. I'm staying. I've got 
everything I want right here.

[He hugs Umbriel.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(shouting) I'm bored! Let's go!

[Outside Colonel's House. On the porch Fry shakes hands with 
his old friends as they leave.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
You know, Fry, I've got a little place 
just outside town. You could come visit, 
maybe?

[Fry looks at the Colonel who shakes his head.]

<character>FRY</character>
Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join 
the country club.

[Bender hugs Fry.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) Oh, Fry!  I'll miss you!

[He leaves and the Colonel waves.]

<character>COLONEL</character>
Y'all come back now, y'hear?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(shouting) Let's go, damnit! Let's go!

[Ships Airlock. Farnsworth opens the door and the crew walk in. 
Zoidberg stops outside.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Well, I guess this is goodbye for me 
as well.

<character>LEELA</character>
Whatever.

<character>AMY</character>
Later.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Bye.

[Cut to: Seabed. Zoidberg turns away sadly and the door closes 
behind him. He screams. His shell is a burned ruin.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
No! My home! It burned down!  (crying) 
How did this happen?

<character>HERMES</character>
That's a very good question.

[Bender picks something up.]

<character>BENDER</character>
So that's where I left my cigar.

[He smokes it.]

<character>HERMES</character>
That just raises further questions!

[Umbriel's Bedroom. Fry and Umbriel sit on her bed.]

<character>FRY</character>
You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours 
have been the happiest days of my life.

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman 
outta mer-me.

[She gets under the sheet and her top floats away.]

<character>FRY</character>
Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the 
vapours!

[He tears his clothes off and dives under the sheets. He and 
Umbriel kiss and her tail flaps around.]

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
What the hell is that?

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah I'm a little confused too. How 
do I ... y'know ... with the tail and 
all?

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I 
lay my eggs and leave and you release 
your fertiliser.

[Outside Colonel's House. Fry runs away from the house.]

<character>FRY</character>
(gasping) Why couldn't she be the other 
type of mermaid, with the fish part 
on top and the lady part on the bottom?

[The Colonel and Umbriel open the door.]

<character>UMBRIEL</character>
Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante 
Ball?

<character>COLONEL</character>
Well what about that rich young dugong 
from Macon?

[Ships Cockpit.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
There! The engine modifications are 
complete.

<character>LEELA</character>
Prepare for launch.

[Cut to: Seabed. The ship takes off from the rocky bed. The engine 
has been modified to flap around like a fish tail. Fry misses 
the ship.]

<character>FRY</character>
Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!

[He sees Bender's fish hook and chases it. He leaps up and grabs 
it and it pulls him upwards. The giant bass swims up behind him, 
he screams and the bass eats him.]

[Port. The bass is hanging from a giant set of scales. Mayor 
Poopenmeyer, photographers and other people are crowded around 
Bender.]

<character>POOPENMEYER</character>
And so, in honour of his record-breaking 
catch, I'm proud to award Bender this 
cheque for $1000.

[He shakes Bender's hand and photographers take photos. The crowd 
cheers. The bass spits out Fry followed by Hermes' manwich.]

<character>LEELA</character>
It's you!

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, buddy!

<character>HERMES</character>
My manwich!

<character>LEELA</character>
Fry, are you alright? What happened?

<character>AMY</character>
What about Umbriel?

<character>FRY</character>
Well, it turns out I loved her, but 
I wasn't in love with her.

<character>AMY</character>
(whispering) Trouble in bed.

[Leela nods.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy.

[He puts his arms around Fry. Poopenmeyer looks at the scales.]

<character>POOPENMEYER</character>
Wait a-- This is no record! Gimmie back 
that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant 
orphans.

[He snatches the cheque from Bender. Fry starts struggling.]

<character>FRY</character>
Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!

[He chokes. The bass' gills open. Zoidberg is inside.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!

<character>THE END</character>

<character>DONOVAN</character>
(over credits) Hail Atlanta!
