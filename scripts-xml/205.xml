[Advertisement: Fry, Bender and Leela appear as heroes in an 
oval.]

<character>ANNOUNCER</character>
(voice-over) Futurama is brought to 
you by ...  ... Glagnar's Human Rinds. 
It's a buncha muncha cruncha human!

[The monster bites one from a packet.]

[Opening Credits. Caption: Made From Meat By-Products.]

[Planet Express: Kitchen. Leela picks up a huge can of Kibbles 
'n' Snouts and carries it over to a huge electric can opener 
on the wall.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Balcony. Nibbler is asleep. His third 
eye perks up and looks around when he hears the can opener. He 
runs inside.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Kitchen. Fry gets some coffee. Leela 
tips the can over and the meat slowly slides out from inside. 
Nibbler sits in his food dish and the meat falls on him and he 
scoffs it in a few bites.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Aww! Somebody likes snouts.

<character>FRY</character>
Is it me?

[Bender wanders in humming to himself. The magnet on the can 
opener pulls him off the floor and starts cutting into him.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Ow, my head! My precious 
head!  (talking) Stupid can opener. 
You killed my father and now you've 
come back for me!

<character>FRY</character>
You alright, Bender?

[Bender rubs his head. The top half is cut like a half-open can.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah, I guess so. But I don't see why 
we keep this ticking time-bomb around 
just for that dumb animal.

<character>LEELA</character>
Don't yell at Nibbler like that.  You 
hurt his feelings. Come on, pet him 
and make up.

<character>BENDER</character>
No.

<character>LEELA</character>
I said pet him.

<character>BENDER</character>
I'll pet him. I'll pet him with both 
hands!  Ow! My ass! Get off!

[Nibbler lets go.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Are you alright?

<character>BENDER</character>
Ah, it's nothing a lawsuit won't cure.

<character>LEELA</character>
Not you.  Aww, poor baby chipped a fang.

[She carries Nibbler away and kisses and pets him.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, I got a busted ass here, I don't 
see anyone kissing it.

[Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Zoidberg puts a book down 
and stands up from the table.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(reluctant) Alright, I'm coming.

[Animal Clinic Waiting Room. A man sits stroking a cat, a cat 
sits stroking a man and Leela sits with Nibbler while Fry and 
Bender stand nearby. A door opens and a woman comes out with 
a two-headed dog, followed by the vet, Jeffery Grant.]

<character>JEFFERY</character>
Remember, Rover gets the pill and Pepper 
gets the suppository.  Next.

[Animal Clinic Examination Room. Veterinary surgeries haven't 
changed much in a thousand years; there is a sink, a paper towel 
dispenser and an examination table in the middle of the room 
which Nibbler sits on. Jeffery fetches a small hammer and taps 
Nibbler on the head with it, making him squeal. He looks in his 
mouth.]

<character>JEFFERY</character>
It's just a simple broken fang, nothing 
serious.

<character>BENDER</character>
What's that you say there, doctor? You're 
gonna have to put him down?

<character>JEFFERY</character>
No-- what? Huh?

[He looks at Fry and Leela in confusion. Bender shakes his head.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Terrible shame that. Shall I do the 
honours?

[He reaches up to a shelf and takes down a bottle with some pink 
liquid in it marked "Goose Laxative". He holds the bottle by 
it's neck, smashes it on a table and points it at Nibbler. Leela 
reaches across.]

<character>LEELA</character>
No!

[She rips Bender's arm off and smacks it against the table until 
it lets go of the broken bottle.]

<character>BENDER</character>
You about done?

<character>LEELA</character>
Next time I'm keeping it.

[She tosses the arm over her shoulder and Bender reattaches it.]

<character>JEFFERY</character>
OK, well I believe I have a replacement 
fang for your pet in the next room. 
The jaguar didn't wanna cooperate but 
luckily he knocked one of my teeth out. 
Now then.

[He pulls out the broken crown of Nibbler's fang and sets it 
down on a table. Fry picks it up.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, what are these rings in Nibbler's 
fang?

[Jeffery attaches Nibbler's new tooth with a laser.]

<character>JEFFERY</character>
Um, I'm still a little woozy from a 
gazelle kick this morning but if he's 
anything like the common tree, the rings 
might indicate his age.

[Fry laughs.]

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, well, good luck. It'd take some 
kind of genius to count all those rings.

[Jeffery takes a look.]

<character>JEFFERY</character>
He's five.

[Planet Express: Lounge. A "Happy 5th Birthday Nibbler" banner 
has been strung up on the wall.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Happy birthday, young Nibbler.

[Everyone is sat on the floor surrounded by opened presents. 
The room has been decorated with balloons and streamers and Fry 
sticks a picture to the wall. Nibbler scratches himself and runs 
around.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Aww, look how cuddly he looks in his 
new cape!

<character>BENDER</character>
(sarcastic) I'd be cuddly too if someone 
gave me a new cape.

<character>FRY</character>
Who's playing pin the tail on the moon 
maggot?

[Bender snatches a tail from his hand.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ooh, me! Everyone watch how good I am. 
And the crowd goes wild! What prize 
do I get? Cash?

[He turns around. No one is interested.]

<character>AMY</character>
Hey, look at Nibbler!

[Nibbler is sat in a high-chair at the table and chews a spoon.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Aww, he's holding a spoon.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
He's so talented!

<character>BENDER</character>
You call that talent? Gather round old 
Bender and get ready for the show of 
a lifetime.  Ta-da!

[He grumbles when no one watches. Leela puts a pointy party hat 
on Nibbler and his third eye pops out the top. Hermes gasps.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Now he's wearing a hat!

<character>LEELA</character>
Come on, let's all sing Happy Birthday!

[They do, all except Bender.]

<character>ALL</character>
(singing) What day is today?

It's Nibbler's birthday,

What a day for a birthday,

Let's all have some cake.

<character>FRY</character>
(singing) ... and you smell like one 
too!

[He giggles and they all applaud.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, what about this?

[He dances around and whistles Sweet Georgia Brown again.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, I thought you were supposed 
to be cooking for this party.

<character>BENDER</character>
Fine, we'll have rack of Nibbler.

<character>LEELA</character>
Just make a simple cake. And this time, 
if someone's going to jump out of it, 
make sure you put them in after you 
cook it.

<character>BENDER</character>
So it's a cake you want, is it? I'll 
make you a cake you'll never forget.

[Planet Express: Kitchen. Bender takes some rat poison out of 
a cupboard and laughs insanely as he tips it onto something. 
It turns out he is pouring it next to a hole in the bottom of 
the wall.]

<character>BENDER</character>
That'll take care of those annoying 
rats.  Now, to bake a cake so delicious 
they'll have no choice but to love and 
worship me.

[He whistles Sweet Georgia Brown as he walks to the fridge and 
takes two eggs out of a 12-pack of various grade bird eggs. He 
juggles them around, then rolls them across his shoulders and 
into a bowl. He tips in some flour, some Third & Third & Third 
and then uses his hand to whisk the mixture. He pours the mixture 
into a cake tin, puts the tin in his chest cabinet and switches 
it from refrigerate to E-Z bake, closes the door and hums as 
it cooks.]

[Time Lapse. Bender ices the 5-tier birthday cake and puts a 
little Bender ornament on the top.]

<character>BENDER</character>
There! This'll teach those filthy bastards 
who's lovable. Now all I have to do 
is spell check it and it's ready for 
my admiring public.  No! Get away from 
there!  That's it.

[Planet Express: Bathroom. Bender carries Nibbler in holding 
him by his eyestalk and lifts the toilet seat lid.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Happy birthday!

[He drops Nibbler in and flushes the toilet. Nibbler starts turning. 
Enter Leela.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, what's going--  (crying) No!

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey! Can't you see I'm using the toilet?

[Planet Express: Meeting Room. Leela sits at the table crying 
with the rest of the staff gathered around her.]

<character>AMY</character>
Bender! How could you flush Nibbler 
down the toilet?

[Bender sits on a chair with his feet on the table smoking a 
cigar.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, step one, I had to lift the seat. 
That was the first little annoyance. 
Am I right, men?

<character>LEELA</character>
(crying) Aren't you upset at all? How 
would you feel if I flushed Fry down 
the toilet?

<character>BENDER</character>
Only one way to find out.

<character>LEELA</character>
(crying) You have no sympathy for anyone 
else's feelings.

<character>BENDER</character>
Of course I do. Right now I feel sorry 
for you.

<character>LEELA</character>
You do?

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah. I mean, one cantaloupe-sized bloodshot 
eye? You ain't winning no beauty pageants, 
lady.

[Leela cries some more.]

[Planet Express: Bathroom. Everyone except Bender stands around 
the toilet. Leela dabs her eyes with a tissue.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
And so we say goodbye to our beloved 
pet Nibbler, who's gone to a place where 
I too hope one day to go: The toilet.

[Leela sobs and Fry nods to Hermes, who places a lily into the 
toilet. He nods back to Fry and he flushes the lily away.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(crying) I wouldn't feel so bad if Bender 
just understood the pain he caused me.

[They hear Bender laughing.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. They peer around the door. Bender 
is watching All My Circuits. Calculon is lying in a hospital 
bed.]

<character>CALCULON</character>
Give it to me straight, doctor -- don't 
sugarcoat it.

<character>DOCTORBOT</character>
Very well. Your entire family died 
when a plane piloted by your fianc�e 
crashed into your uninsured home. And 
you have inoperable cancer.

[Bender laughs and kicks his legs.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Bet you weren't expecting that one, 
Calculon!

[Cut to: Planet Express: Bathroom.]

<character>AMY</character>
It's like he doesn't understand simple 
humanoid emotion.

<character>LEELA</character>
I wish just once Bender could feel exactly 
what I feel.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Actually, through the miracle of science, 
that can be arranged.

<character>FRY</character>
Uh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy 
experiment that crosses a line Man was 
not meant to cross?

[Farnsworth makes the "little bit" gesture.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Bender watches the news.]

<character>LINDA</character>
The official death toll in that tragic 
rocket crash has now been raised to 
54,000.

[Bender sniggers and Fry, Hermes and Zoidberg grab him and pin 
him to the table. Farnsworth unscrews his head.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, what the hell are you doing with 
my head?

[Farnsworth carries him across the room.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I need to tinker in it.

<character>BENDER</character>
Why don't you just use a potted plant 
like Fry?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Quiet, you. I'm installing an empathy 
chip.

[He holds up a little green chip in a pair of pliers.]

<character>FRY</character>
And that'll allow Bender to feel other 
people's emotions?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yes. If by "allow" you mean "force".

[He screws Bender's head into a vice and starts hammering the 
chip into the side of it.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ooh! Ow! Son of a-- Careful with that! 
Ow ...

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh dear, oh my. I got it. Once more.

<character>BENDER</character>
... Ow! Professor!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Steady now.

<character>BENDER</character>
Ow!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
There we go.  Now I'll simply tune it 
to Leela's emotional frequency.

[He turns the chip with a screwdriver. It beeps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
My God, I'm overcome with ... feelings. 
I'm experiencing a powerful yearning 
to ... to cram my gullet full of mackerel 
heads.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
That's me, baby!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Hmm.

[He turns the chip again.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Now I'm worried that I'm not as smart 
as Leela, but at the same time I feel 
relieved that I'm cuter than her.

<character>AMY</character>
Uh ... that's me.

[She raises her hand and Fry leans back.]

<character>FRY</character>
(whispering) Thanks for covering.

[Farnsworth turns the chip again.]

<character>BENDER</character>
This time I miss Nibbler and I'm feeling 
nosy and opinionated.

<character>AMY</character>
Bingo!

<character>HERMES</character>
That's Leela!

<character>LEELA</character>
Thank you, Professor. I'm happy that 
Bender can finally feel my pain.

[The chip beeps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Happy. I like this feeling. Just don't 
revert to your usual mopey self.

<character>LEELA</character>
I'm not mopey. You shut up!

[The chip beeps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Anger, huh? How dare you make me feel 
anger, you one-eyed jerk with a dead 
pet!

[He laughs and Leela cries. The chip beeps and he cries too.]

[O'Zorgnax's Pub. Amy and Leela are on a girl's night out. Leela 
is wearing a blue dress and Amy is wearing a green top.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Thanks for taking me out, Amy. I feel 
slightly less miserable already.

<character>AMY</character>
Hey, you know what'd cheer you up? You 
should get a puppy.

<character>LEELA</character>
A puppy? Nibbler loved to eat puppies.

[She bursts into tears.]

[Fry and Bender's Lounge. They sit watching TV and Bender suddenly 
cries.]

<character>FRY</character>
What's your problem?

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) I miss Nibbler.

<character>FRY</character>
You do?

<character>BENDER</character>
Hell, no! It's Leela's stupid feelings. 
Why can't she just drink herself happy 
like a normal person?

[He cries and drinks down the bottle.]

[O'Zorgnax's Pub. Amy and a Hispanic guy dance closely. Leela 
drums her fingers and growls.]

[Fry and Bender's Lounge. Bender's chip beeps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Uh-oh, jealousy.  (shouting) You think 
you're so hot!

<character>FRY</character>
What?

<character>BENDER</character>
The only reason you get all the guys 
is because you dress like a tramp!

[He slaps Fry, making him drop his Slurm.]

<character>FRY</character>
(crying) They're just responding to 
my personality.

[O'Zorgnax's Pub. Leela is still sat at the bar. The guy has 
his arm around Amy.]

<character>AMY</character>
Um, Leela? Armando and I are going to 
the back seat of his car for coffee. 
You gonna be alright here by yourself?

<character>LEELA</character>
(theatrical happiness) Sure. I'm having 
a great time -- really. You two go enjoy 
yourselves.

[They leave.]

[Fry and Bender's Lounge.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) I'm so lonely. I'm gonna go 
eat a bucket of ice cream.  (crying) 
A bucket of ...

[He sobs.]

<character>FRY</character>
(shouting) The spoon's in the foot powder.

[Planet Express: Meeting Room. A tear streams down Leela's face 
as she looks at a photo of her and Nibbler in one of those things 
at a beach where the head is cut out. Bender and Fry watch from 
the doorway. Bender sighs.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm at the end of my rope. I can't live 
another minute without poor, sweet Nibbler.

<character>FRY</character>
Too bad he wasn't an alligator. Y'know, 
when you flush those things they stay 
alive in the sewers.

<character>BENDER</character>
Really?

<character>FRY</character>
Yep. My friend's cousin's caseworker 
saw one once. It's a widely-believed 
fact.

<character>BENDER</character>
Hmm, sewers.  Thinking, thinking, thinking.

[Planet Express: Bathroom. He stands in the toilet.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hang on, Nibbler. Uncle Bender's coming 
to save you.  Damn, it's too small. 
What did those human design this for 
anyway?  Aha! Bender, one; toilet, zero! 
See you on the other side!

[His body waves goodbye. Someone knocks on the door.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Fry pounds on the door.]

<character>FRY</character>
Bender? Bender?!

[Cut to: Planet Express: Bathroom. He forces the door open.]

<character>FRY</character>
Have you seen my sombrero?

[He gasps as Bender's right arm flushes itself away.]

[Planet Express: Meeting Room. The crew are sat around the table.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Now he's flushed himself down the toilet? 
Who's he gonna flush next?

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, it's your fault. He only flushed 
himself because your emotions made him 
feel bad.

<character>LEELA</character>
You're right. I feel terrible.

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, great, now you're making him feel 
worse!

<character>LEELA</character>
I guess we'd better go down into the 
sewers and look for him.

<character>AMY</character>
Are you crazy? There's mutants down 
there! They'll eat you alive.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
They're hideous!

[He screams and clacks his claws at her.]

<character>LEELA</character>
There's no such thing as mutants. That's 
a ridiculous urban myth.

[Farnsworth spins around in his chair.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh, don't be so sure. Many scientists 
believe humans really could mutate down 
there. Uh, due to exposure to toxic 
waste and radioactive runoff and good 
old American faeces.

[Fry holds his hand to his heart.]

<character>FRY</character>
God bless America.

[New New York City Street. In the middle of the road outside 
the Planet Express building, Leela lifts a manhole cover with 
a picture of Thurgood Stubbs from The PJs engraved on it. Fry 
peers down the hole as she drags it away.]

<character>FRY</character>
Phew! Uh, ladies first.

[She pushes him down the hole and he screams before splashing 
into the sewer water below.]

[Cut to: New New York City Sewers. Leela peers down the hole 
and Fry splutters and spits.]

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, and the aftertaste!

[Time Lapse. Leela and Fry crawl through the pitch black tunnels. 
Fry lights a match and screams.]

<character>LEELA</character>
What is it?

<character>FRY</character>
I burned my finger.

[Time Lapse. They float down the sewer river on an inflatable 
yellow raft pointing flashlights around.]

<character>LEELA</character>
OK, check the guidebook.

[Fry shines his torch onto a page in Let's Go Sewers.]

<character>FRY</character>
Looks like we're under Park Avenue. 
Ooh, ritzy! Just think: All this was 
probably once a charity luncheon for 
the Met.

[A noise comes from down the sewers.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Wait, what's that?

[They shine their torches down the tunnels and see Bender at 
the other end trying to reattach his limbs. He has put his right 
arm in his right leg socket and his right leg to the right arm 
socket. He groans.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I never should have thrown out the manual.

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, you didn't have to come down 
here.

<character>BENDER</character>
I know. But I just missed Nibbler so 
much.

<character>LEELA</character>
(crying) He was so cute.

[The chip beeps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) He was so sweet.

[They hug.]

<character>FRY</character>
Eck! This emotional display is making 
me nauseous.  Or maybe it's whatever 
that is.

[Time Lapse. The trio sit in the raft as it carries on through 
the sewers. Bender's arms and legs are in the right place.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(shouting) Nibbler?

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Nibbler?

[Leela sighs.]

<character>LEELA</character>
It's no use. We'd better turn back. 
Which way, Fry?

<character>FRY</character>
Hmm. According to this map, the only 
way out is through ... that pipe.  Don't 
worry. It gets wider after about a mile.

[Leela and Bender look at each other and the chip beeps.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(simultaneously) Idiot.

<character>BENDER</character>
(simultaneously) Idiot.

[Fry sighs.]

<character>FRY</character>
OK, OK, nevermind. I'll just ask those 
people for directions.

[He points the torch at some hideous creatures all with extra 
bodily features such as arms, eyes, noses, hands. They growl.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(shouting) Mutants!

[Fry screams, then Leela, then - after his chip has beeped - 
Bender.]

[Time Lapse. Leela, Fry and Bender stand in the sewer water staring 
at the mutants.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Mutants! They're real!

[She and Bender flinch. Fry pushes them aside.]

<character>FRY</character>
I'll take care of this!  Back! Back!

[One of the mutants, Vyolet, a hideous woman with green scaly 
skin, a snout and gills, steps forwards and uses the flaming 
guidebook to light her cigarette. She smokes it and smoke comes 
out of her gills.]

<character>VYOLET</character>
Thanks, handsome.

[A mutant, called Dwayne, with a huge forehead and two noses 
steps forward.]

<character>DWAYNE</character>
Please, do not be frightened, we're 
harmless.

<character>RAOUL</character>
I have three arms.

<character>DWAYNE</character>
I said "harmless" not "armless".

<character>VYOLET</character>
Lay off him. You know he's only got 
one ear.

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, aren't you supposed to be eating 
our brains? You're mutants.

<character>DWAYNE</character>
Mutants? Perhaps it is you who are the 
mutants.

<character>VYOLET</character>
Please, Dwayne, have you looked in a 
mirror lately?

[Mutant Village. The mutants lead Fry, Leela and Bender down 
the tunnels and into an open space with buildings and other mutants.]

<character>RAOUL</character>
Welcome to our village. It may not be 
Paris but it has a certain quaint charm 
that I, for one, wouldn't trade for 
the world.

<character>BENDER</character>
You guys realise you live in a sewer, 
right?

<character>DWAYNE</character>
Perhaps. But perhaps your civilisation 
is merely the sewer of an even greater 
society above you.

<character>LEELA</character>
No, we're on the top.

<character>FRY</character>
Daylight and everything.

[Dwayne groans.]

<character>VYOLET</character>
It must be wonderful.

<character>BENDER</character>
Eh.

[He makes the middle-of-the-road gesture.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Listen. We actually came down here to 
find our pet, Nibbler. He got flushed 
down the toilet.

<character>RAOUL</character>
Well if he got flushed down the toilet 
he probably came through here. Everything 
always does. Follow me.  All that is 
ours was once flushed down your toilets. 
Over there is our aquarium.  This is 
our library.

[The library is just a shelf. Bender looks at what is on offer.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Nothing but crumpled porno and Ayn Rand.

[He holds up Atlas Shrugged.]

<character>RAOUL</character>
And over here is our church.

[Cut to: Mutant Church. Fry opens the door and looks around. 
In front of the altar is a huge nuclear warhead.]

<character>FRY</character>
Wow. You guys worship an unexploded 
nuclear bomb?

[Cut to: Mutant Village.]

<character>VYOLET</character>
Yeah, but nobody's that observant. It's 
mainly a Christmas and Easter thing.

[Time Lapse. The group walk down a street and pass lots and lots 
of dry cleaners.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(shouting) Nibbler?

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Come to Daddy, sweetie-ookums.

<character>FRY</character>
So, is it true that alligators flushed 
down the toilet survive down here?

<character>VYOLET</character>
No. That's just an urban legend.

<character>BENDER</character>
Then what are those?

<character>VYOLET</character>
Crocodiles.

[She snorts.]

<character>RAOUL</character>
We keep them as pets. Then, when they 
grow too large, we flush them down into 
the sub-sewer.

[He points to a huge toilet in the middle of the mutant town.]

<character>DWAYNE</character>
Some say there's a freakish race of 
sub-mutants down there.

<character>VYOLET</character>
Please, that's just a sub-urban legend.

<character>DWAYNE</character>
Oh? Then I suppose you also don't believe 
in ...  ... El Chupanibre.

[The other mutants gasp.]

<character>LEELA</character>
El Chupanibre? What's that?

[Dwayne strums a guitar.]

<character>DWAYNE</character>
Gather round, children, for the legend 
of El Chupanibre.

(singing) He creeps and crawls in the midnight hush,

Silent as a low-flow toilet flush,

Watch your step,

'Cause sooner or later,

He'll eat you whole,

And half your alligator.

<character>VYOLET</character>
Crocodile.

<character>DWAYNE</character>
Whatever.

[Vyolet snorts.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Wait. Our pet Nibbler loves fresh crocodile. 
It's his favourite treat. He must be 
El Chupanibre.

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, yeah!

<character>RAOUL</character>
You unleashed the dreaded El Chupanibre 
upon us? Then you are our sworn enemies.

[The growling mutants surround them.]

<character>LEELA</character>
You don't understand. He would never 
hurt people. Let us help you capture 
him.

<character>DWAYNE</character>
Impossible. If the legend is true, our 
only hope is to offer him a snack-rifice.

<character>RAOUL</character>
Yes. An unspoiled virgin.

<character>LEELA</character>
I volunteer.

<character>VYOLET</character>
Nice try, Leela, but we've all seen 
Zapp Brannigan's webpage.

[Bender laughs and Leela looks sad. Bender's chip beeps and he 
groans.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, I made myself feel bad.

<character>RAOUL</character>
She'll have to do. Chain her to the 
post!  And rip her shirt a little.  
Behold. When El Chupanibre comes for 
the, uh, "virgin", he will be snared 
by this rope trap.

<character>DWAYNE</character>
(quietly) Shh. El Chupanibre comes soon. 
It is nightfall.

<character>LEELA</character>
Nightfall? How can you tell down here?

[Splashing noises echo around the village.]

<character>DWAYNE</character>
The tide is coming in.

[Vyolet lies with her ear to the water.]

<character>VYLOET</character>
Quiet, the beast approaches.

[Loud bangs come from the pipe as El Chupanibre gets closer. 
The mutants, Fry and Bender scarper. Fry dives behind some boxes 
and Bender and Dwayne join him. Raoul runs into a building and 
draws the curtains across him. El Chupanibre's shadow appears 
and Leela gasps. The huge shadow gets smaller and it turns out 
to be Nibbler.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Nibbler! Aw, come here precious!  Look 
everyone, it's El Chupanibre.

<character>DWAYNE</character>
That's not El Chupanibre.

<character>BENDER</character>
Say what?

<character>DWAYNE</character>
That's El Chupanibre.

[He points to a huge green monster standing in the pipe looking 
down on Bender. It has fangs and yellow bloodshot eyes. Bender 
looks round, screams, drops Nibbler and runs away.]

<character>FRY</character>
I'll take care of this.

[He steps into the rope trap and screams as it lifts him off 
the ground and leaves him dangling overhead. El Chupanibre gets 
closer to Nibbler. Leela screams, making Bender scream.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, do something.

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm too scared.

<character>FRY</character>
Leela, your scaredness is being transmitted 
straight to Bender. If you care about 
Nibbler, stop caring about him!

<character>LEELA</character>
I can't. I love every living creature.

<character>FRY</character>
Even me?

<character>LEELA</character>
As a friend.

<character>FRY</character>
Damn.

[Leela starts to cry.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Listen to me, Leela: I'm an expert at 
not caring. The secret is to stop giving 
a rat's ass about anyone else and start 
thinking of the things that you want, 
that you deserve, that the world owes 
you.

[El Chupanibre edges closer to Nibbler.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, I could use a new tank top.

<character>BENDER</character>
Bigger! Bigger!

<character>LEELA</character>
A fashionable tank top. And designer 
boots ... encrusted with jewels.

<character>BENDER</character>
Don't stop now, you'll need some pants 
to go with that outfit.

<character>LEELA</character>
Yeah. And I could afford it all if I 
didn't have to feed that stupid Nibbler.

[Bender's chip beeps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Bender is back. I'll save you, Nibbler.

[He kicks Nibbler out the way and starts rotating his arms. El 
Chupanibre grabs them and pulls them off. Bender groans. El Chupanibre 
grabs him and lifts him towards his mouth.]

<character>FRY</character>
Bender's gonna be killed!

<character>LEELA</character>
You know what else I could use? A weekend 
at one of those fancy spas. And a Toblerone.

[El Chupanibre prepares to eat Bender. Bender's detached arms 
tap him on the shoulder and he looks around. They punch him and 
he drops Bender. Bender charges at him and knocks him flying 
into the huge toilet. His arms flush the monster away and everyone 
cheers.]

<character>FRY</character>
(cheering) Yeah!

<character>LEELA</character>
You did it!

<character>RAOUL</character>
Let's have a tissue-tape parade!

<character>BENDER</character>
No thanks.

[Dwayne unties Leela and another mutant cuts Fry down. He falls 
into the water and splutters. Nibbler runs towards Leela and 
jumps into her arms and licks her. Dwayne sits on the toilet 
with his guitar.]

<character>DWAYNE</character>
Gather round, children, to hear the 
legend of Bender.

[He strums the guitar.]

(singing) He came from above with a--

[A string snaps and he sighs.]

(talking) It's gonna be many a year before someone flushes another 
guitar string.

[Planet Express: Meeting Room. Fry, Leela and Bender are back 
and everyone is with them. Bender holds a cigar.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
That was a disgusting story.

<character>LEELA</character>
And it's all thanks to Bender. I love 
you, Bender.

<character>BENDER</character>
I love you too.  Get that stupid chip 
out of me before I kill myself!

[Farnsworth prises the chip off with a screwdriver and looks 
at it.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Bender, you won't believe this, but 
the empathy chip burned out. The emotion 
you felt for Nibbler was actually your 
own.

<character>FRY</character>
Looks like Bender learned an important 
lesson about respecting other people's 
feelings afterall.

[Everyone else nods and murmurs in agreement.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was 
running at triple capacity.

<character>BENDER</character>
And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, 
losers!

[He walks out.]

<character>LEELA</character>
You know, Bender may not have learned 
anything from me, but I think I actually 
learned something from him.  (shouting) 
So long, jerkwads!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
So long!
