[Opening Credits. Caption: If Accidentally Watched, Induce Vomitting.]

[Planet Express: Kitchen. Bender watches Good Morning Earth on 
<character>TV</character>. A graphic of the sun peeking over the Earth appears on the 
screen then it changes to Morbo and Linda in the regular Good 
Morning Earth studio.]

<character>MORBO </character>[ON TV]
Welcome back. Our next guest has been 
teaching the world to cook for over 
20 years. But apparently my uh, wife 
hasn't been listening.

[A laughter track is heard and Linda chuckles.]

<character>LINDA </character>[ON TV]
Oh funny!

<character>ELZAR </character>[ON TV]
Morbo I'm gonna whip you up a nice, 
unnameable horror from beyond - with 
mango chutney.

[He lifts a pot onto a hob. Morbo looks inside. Radiation flares 
out of the pot and X-rays his head.]

<character>MORBO </character>[ON TV]
Pathetic humans! Prepare to write down 
the recipe!

[Bender hums as he stirs a pot of...something. Enter Fry.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, uh, what's with all the pots and 
pans? You building a wife?

<character>BENDER</character>
Part of one. Meantime I'm cooking up 
a tasty Sunday brunch for my best friends!

[He takes a chicken out of his chest cabinet and swallows it. 
Shredding, whirring sounds come from inside him and he spits 
out the chicken's skeleton. He dusts it off and puts it in a 
frying pan.]

<character>FRY</character>
Brunch. Right. I'd better warn - tell 
- warntell the others!

<character>BENDER</character>
Okey-dokey!

[Fry leaves and Bender covers the chicken with a whole tub of 
Motron's Salt. He opens another tub and adds an extra pinch of 
it.]

[Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. The crew sans Fry and Bender 
are gathered around Farnsworth's lab table looking at a ship 
in a bottle.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Ooo!

<character>LEELA</character>
Nice!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yes, it's a perfect scale model of the 
universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny 
spaceship inside to keep it from being 
boring.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Ohh!

[He reaches out to the bottle.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Get -!  For the last time Zoidberg look 
with your eyes not with your claws!

[He puts the bottle back on the table. Enter Fry.]

<character>FRY</character>
Brace yourselves. Bender is making us 
brunch.

[Everyone gasps.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Oh boy!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh God! My tract!

[He clutches his stomach.]

<character>FRY</character>
He's so proud of his awful cooking. 
If we don't eat it he'll be crushed.

<character>LEELA</character>
Alright don't panic. If we can get to 
the ship, we can fly north and hide 
under the polar icecaps for a few weeks.

<character>FRY</character>
Hurry!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Good idea!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
What's the hold-up?

[They make for the door. It opens and Bender is standing there 
stirring a bowl of slop.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Fleeing somewhere?

<character>FRY</character>
Uh, with you blocking the only escape 
route? Don't be silly!

<character>BENDER</character>
In that case brunch is served! Let's 
go, move it out, stop crying Leela!

[They all file out and Leela carries on crying. Farnsworth pokes 
his head through the doorway.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Zoidberg, are you coming?

[Zoidberg stops reaching for the bottle.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Sure. Me.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Because I don't want you touching that 
thing.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
I know that.  Surrender your mysteries 
to Zoidberg!  Oh no! Professor will 
hit me. But if Zoidberg fixes it, then 
perhaps gifts!  Ow, what? Ohh!

[Planet Express: Lounge. The crew are sat around the table and 
Bender dishes up.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Today, I've personalised each of your 
meals. For example, Amy, you're cute, 
so I baked you a pony.  Come on! Eat! 
I slaved all day over a filthy stove!

[He walks into the kitchen.]

<character>HERMES</character>
This is terrible!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Good thing I secretly installed this 
wormhole in the table!

[He presses a button and the wormhole opens in the middle of 
the table and scrapes his food - a human heart and some guts 
- into it.]

<character>AMY</character>
Where does the other end come out?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
You know I'm not quite sure.  Oh dear 
me!

[He takes a cloth out of his lab coat and puts his hand in the 
wormhole and wipes the food from off his head. Enter Bender humming. 
His antenna pop-ups and dings like a microwave. He takes something 
green out of his chest cabinet.]

<character>BENDER</character>
The pie is ready. You guys like swarms 
of things right?

[Things crawl around underneath the pie crust. Enter Zoidberg 
wearing a uncharacteristic long coat. The lab equipment pokes 
out from the coat and there is a cuckoo clock behind his head.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Casual hello, it's me Zoidberg, act 
naturally.  Ow! Ouch! Get off of me! 
Stop!

<character>LEELA</character>
How interesting Dr Zoidberg. Do go on.

[She scrapes her food into a plant and sits down. Bender doesn't 
notice. He walks back towards the kitchen, humming. He notices 
the dead plant.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey check out the palm tree! It only 
gets sick when I cook brunch! How's 
that for a coincidence Professor? With 
all your precious science!

[He walks through the door.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Kitchen. Bender stirs a mop around in 
a bucket of filthy water and wrings it out into some glasses. 
He opens the door a little way and hears Fry talking.]

<character>FRY </character>[<character>FROM LOUNGE</character>]
Man, I don't wanna hurt Bender's feelings...

[Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge.]

<character>FRY</character>
...but this food actually tastes better 
as vomit!

<character>LEELA</character>
It's unbearable! How much do you think 
it would cost to get my tongue removed?

[Bender is standing in the doorway crying. He drops the tray 
of glasses and runs back into the kitchen. Whatever was in the 
glasses dissolves the floor.]

[Planet Express: Locker Area. Bender opens his locker and takes 
out his personalised notepaper headed with "A Note From Bender," 
"A Ransom Note From Bender" and "A Plea For Attention From Bender." 
He clicks his finger and a pen comes out and he starts writing 
on the latter paper. He looks at the checklist. "I Am Committing 
Suicide," "I Am Getting A Tattoo" and "I Am Running Away." He 
ticks the last one.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) And this time I mean it!

[He ticks "And This Time I Mean It."]

[Outside Planet Express. Bender walks away from the building 
with a bindle over his shoulder. He throws his chef's hat down 
and squeaking rats run out of it.]

[Street. Bender walks down the street still crying.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Aw, who am I kidding? It was stupid 
of me to ever dream of becoming a chef. 
I don't have what it takes and nothing 
can change that.  Then it's settled! 
Elzar will teach me to cook!

[Elzar's Kitchen.]

<character>ELZAR</character>
Absolutely not.

[Bender has his arms wrapped around Elzar's legs.]

<character>BENDER</character>
But I watch your show. You owe me!

<character>ELZAR</character>
I owe you nothing! For starter's your 
antenna's in my crotch. Also I hate 
you. Finally, you can't cook for squat.

[Bender cries then suddenly stops.]

<character>BENDER</character>
What was the first one again?

<character>ELZAR</character>
I hate you.

<character>BENDER</character>
I thought that was number two.

<character>ELZAR</character>
I knocked it up a notch. Bam!

[He points to the door.]

[Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Zoidberg looks at the broken 
bottle.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Aw, I'll never recombobulate this ship! 
When the Professor finds out, he'll 
tear me a new cloaca!  Wait! What would 
the robot do?  Frame someone.

[Enter Fry.]

<character>FRY</character>
What up?

[Zoidberg laughs insanely.]

[Planet Express: Bathroom. Fry is in the shower with his back 
to the door. Enter Zoidberg.]

<character>FRY</character>
(singing) I'm walking on sunshine!  
La la la la sunshine!

[Zoidberg replaces Fry's T-shirt with one that says "I Hate Bottles" 
and eats the original.]

[New New York Rooftops. Bender sits on some pipes. He has 5 o'clock 
rust.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) It's over! My dream of being 
a chef is deadder than the cat I'm sitting 
on!

[Two hobos stand next to him.]

<character>HOBO</character>
Gus old chum, let's give a friendly 
welcome to this new robo.

[Bender rolls up his sleeves.]

<character>BENDER</character>
What did you call me?

<character>GUS</character>
A robo. You know? A robot-hobo.

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh OK I thought you said "romo."

<character>HOBO</character>
No offence intended my filthy friend. 
In fact, why not join us and ride the 
space rails?

[Space Train. The train heads down a space track carrying trucks 
from such companies as Baltimore & Orion, Starlight Express and 
Wrath-Of-Conrail. The train heads towards a small planet with 
a giant prism sticking out of it. A truck door opens. The hobos 
are wearing spacesuits and Bender is with them.]

<character>GUS</character>
Get ready. We's gonna jump off at that 
switching prism up ahead.

<character>HOBO</character>
We're going nearly the speed of light 
so uh, roll when you land.

[They jump and the train hits the prism and each truck flies 
off in a different direction.]

[Cut to: Planet Surface. The hobos roll when they land and Bender 
lands on his head.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ow.

[Bumbase Alpha. Hobos and Robos warm themselves around fires.]

<character>GUS</character>
Welcome to Bumbase Alpha, the biggest 
hobo jungle in the quadrant.

<character>BENDER</character>
I've seen bigger. Oh wait I'm thinking 
of Eugene Oregon.  Wait. A pie with 
hobo-lifting aroma? Who baked it?

<character>GUS</character>
Helmut Spargle. He used to be the greatest 
chef.

<character>HOBO</character>
His restaurant was so high toned, the 
only way to get reservations was to 
create a parallel universe where you 
already had reservations.

<character>GUS</character>
Yep. I once ate there back when I what 
was a senator.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yo Spargle, if you're such a great cook, 
how'd you end up in this dump?

[Spargle is a small, bald man with a German accent. He sighs.]

<character>SPARGLE</character>
Ages ago I was the host of a TV show...

[Flashback. A younger Helmut Spargle cooks in a studio kitchen.]

<character>SPARGLE</character>
(voice-over) ...Down Home Country Kitchen 
Mit Helmut Spargle. But one day the 
extreme soda company that sponsored 
the show decided it was too old fashioned.

[A man dressed in a Jammin Orange Blast can suit walks in.]

<character>MAN</character>
Spargle, you're fired! We need a chef 
who can attract today's younger extreme 
cooking show viewer.

[Enter a younger Elzar.]

<character>SPARGLE</character>
Elzar!

<character>ELZAR</character>
Get lost old man! Bam!

[Spargle's souffl� collapses.]

<character>SPARGLE</character>
Mein souffl�!

[Flashback ends.]

<character>SPARGLE</character>
Elzar had been seduced by the dark side 
of cooking. Cilantro, mango slasa, raspberry 
vinaigrette!

<character>BENDER</character>
That twizzler!

<character>SPARGLE</character>
As for me, I went temporarily insane 
and vound up here - making pies out 
of shoes.

<character>BENDER</character>
My story's a lot like yours only more 
interesting 'cause it involves robots. 
That jerk Elzar ruined my dream of being 
a chef too.

[He eats a piece of Spargle's pie.]

<character>SPARGLE</character>
Interesting. You wish to become a cook, 
but as a robot you have no sense of 
taste.

<character>BENDER</character>
It's so unfair! I have eight other senses 
but I'd trade them all, even smission, 
to be able to taste.

[He takes the pie out of his chest cabinet.]

<character>SPARGLE</character>
You don't understand. Without the distraction 
of taste, your mind is free to touch 
the Zen of pure flavour. You could become 
the greatest chef ever.

<character>BENDER</character>
I could?

<character>SPARGLE</character>
Yes. Just as Beethoven was a great composer 
because he was deaf!

<character>BENDER</character>
Or like how Rembrandt was blind and 
had wooden hands!

<character>SPARGLE</character>
Bender, hear me well, I shall train 
you. But first you must forget everything 
you know about cooking.

[Bender presses a button on his body and he beeps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Done.

[Montage Bender trains as a chef to Joe Esposito's You're The 
Best � la The Karate Kid. First he learns to peel hover potatoes 
blindfolded � la Luke's Jedi training in A New Hope. Spargle 
puts a salad under Bender's ass and Bender grinds some peppercorns 
by putting them in his mouth and twisting his head. The groud 
pepper drops onto the salad from his ass. Spargle gives him the 
thumbs up. Next Bender chops a vegetable very quickly with a 
knife and ends up chopping up half his arm as well. Spargle takes 
the knife from him, shows it to some hobos and robos and then 
chops a tomato like someone would in those sharp knife adverts. 
The hobos and robos applaud.]

[Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Farnsworth chats to a Spanish 
friend on the phone.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
That's right Ricardo, a ship in a bottle...! 
What's that...? Well hang on, I'll look.

[He turns around and gasps. The bottle and ship are in pieces. 
He drops the phone.]

<character>RICARDO </character>[ON <character>PHONE</character>]
Ola? Professor? Qu� pasa?

[Planet Express: Accusing Parlour. There is a storm outside. 
It is ten to midnight in the accusing parlour and Farnsworth, 
Hermes, Zoidberg, Amy, Leela, Fry and Scruffy are assembled in 
the room. Fry sits with his arms crossed and is not wearing his 
jacket. Farnsworth paces in front of the fire with a flipchart 
to the side of him.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I've gathered you all here in the accusing 
parlour because one of you is a miniature 
ship wrecker!

[Zoidberg gasps.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
I'm acting astonished.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Certain clues suggest the culprit is 
none other than our own...Philip J. 
Fry!

[Everyone gasps. Fry uncrosses his arms revealing his "I Hate 
Bottles" T-shirt underneath.]

<character>FRY</character>
What?!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh it was a brilliant scheme but you 
made one fatal mistake...leaving this 
confession note.

[He holds up a piece of paper with "Fry Confesses" written on 
it. On the bottom of the paper "From The Desk Of Dr John Zoidberg, 
<character>M</character>.D." is printed.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Fry you scoundrel!

<character>FRY</character>
Well, I don't remember any of that but 
I don't have the wherewithal to defend 
myself.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Then I have no choice but to charge 
you the full cost of the materials. 
$10.

[Zoidberg gasps. Fry takes $10 out of his wallet.]

<character>FRY</character>
There you go.

[Zoidberg hears violin strains and puts his claws to his head.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(shouting) What have I done?!

[Bumbase Alpha. Spargle is seated at a table with hobos and robos 
gathered around. Bender walks out of a hut carrying a tray with 
a cover on it. He hums and puts the tray on the table in front 
of Spargle.]

<character>SPARGLE</character>
Your training is complete, little dessert 
spoon. Now, just as the man who wishes 
to be world chess champion must win 
at least one game of chess so must you 
serve at least one edible meal. (whispering) 
Succeed and I shall reveal to you the 
age old secret (whispering more) of 
perfect flavour.

[The crowd gasps.]

<character>GUS</character>
Ooh yeah!

<character>BENDER</character>
Slop's on!

[He lifts the lid. It certainly is slop.]

<character>GUS</character>
Fine lookin' eats!

[Spargle takes a bite and Bender looks on with anticipation. 
Spargle chews and the crowd stares. Spargle swallows.]

<character>SPARGLE</character>
It is...acceptable.

[The hobos cheer.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Yahoo! Another thing I'm great at! Wait. 
Why'd you stop eating master?

<character>SPARGLE</character>
(hoarse) Because...my stomach is about 
to explode.

[The crowd gasps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
What? My dinner killed you? Oh man!

<character>SPARGLE</character>
(hoarse) Oh it hurts. But don't lose 
confidence. The important thing is that 
you defeat Elzar after I am gone.  And 
using this, you cannot fail.

[Bender takes it.]

<character>BENDER</character>
A diamond vial of Mrs Dash?

<character>SPARGLE</character>
(hoarse) No, it is the essence of pure 
flavour. A few drops will cause the 
inner perfection of any dinner to blossom 
forth.  Oh! There goes my...life.

[He dies and falls face first into the plate of slop. The crowd 
gasps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I'll avenge you master. I swear, in 
the presence of these drunken bums, 
that I shall defeat Elzar!

<character>GUS</character>
Oh I'm not drunk, I'm mentally ill! 
But I like what what you said!

[Elzar's Fine Cuisine. Bender meets his opponent.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Elzar, I'm a walking pile of your unfinished 
business!

<character>ELZAR</character>
Why you -

[Bender knocks a spice weasel off Hattie's table and turns to 
Elzar.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Helmut Spargle has a message for you. 
He says (hoarse) "Ooo, I'm dead!"

<character>ELZAR</character>
Spargle huh? What he do, bland himself 
to death?

<character>BENDER</character>
No. He was eating some food I made and 
by a crazy coincidence his stomach exploded. 
Now I'm here to avenge him.

<character>ELZAR</character>
OK but it seems like you're the one 
who killed him.

<character>BENDER</character>
Maybe so but you are his sworn enemy. 
I challenge you to a battle of the chefs.

[He screws of his hand and smacks Elzar with it. The customers 
gasp.]

<character>CUSTOMER</character>
Scandalous!

<character>ELZAR</character>
Very well. We'll meet on the ancient 
televised battleground of Kitchen Coliseum! 
Whosever meal is best will claim the 
title of Iron Cook.

<character>BENDER</character>
Iron Cook eh? I can't lose. I'm 30% 
iron!  You're going down! Uh, also I 
had a reservation for one, under "Dr 
Bender."

[The Planet Express ship crosses the city and lands outside the 
Kitchen Coliseum: Home Of The Kitchen University Wildcats.]

[Kitchen Coliseum. There are two kitchen areas on either side 
of the studio and huge pictures of Elzar and Bender in chef gear. 
The room is darkened.]

<character>HIROKI</character>
Please welcome the superintendant of 
Kitchen Coliseum...Chairman Koji!  No 
robot chef has ever competed here but 
today one has barged his way in to challege 
for the title of...

[Birds fly out from under Koji's cloak.]

<character>KOJI</character>
...Iron Cookuru!

[Bender and Elzar rise from the under the floor in front of their 
pictures. The crowd cheers. Fry and the rest of the Planet Express 
crew watch from the seats.]

<character>FRY</character>
(shouting) Yeah you show 'em!

[In the main part of the studio Hiroki sits with several celebrities 
at a long table.]

<character>HIROKI</character>
Let's meet today's celebrity judges: 
Captain of the Harlem Globetrotters, 
Ethan Bubblegum Tate!

<character>TATE</character>
Konnichiwa brother!

<character>HIROKI</character>
TV anchor-monster Morbo!

<character>MORBO</character>
Greetings pathetic host!

<character>HIROKI</character>
And a woman who ended a thousand year 
war with her apple dandies, Martha Stewart's 
head!

<character>STEWART</character>
The secret is fresh pork.

[Time Lapse.]

<character>HIROKI</character>
And now, chairman Koji will present 
the theme ingredient to be used in every 
dish today.

<character>BENDER</character>
(quietly) If it's chicken: chicken � 
la king. If it's fish: fish � la king. 
If it's turkey: fish � la king!

[Koji pulls a sheet off the ingredient.]

<character>KOJI</character>
Soylent Greuu!

[The camera faces the soylent green and the caption "Soylent 
Green" appears.]

<character>HIROKI</character>
Soylent Green, a classic ingredient 
of gourment cooking. And the battle 
is on.  Aki, what's Elzar making?

<character>AKI</character>
Well Hiroki-san, when I asked him he 
asked what business it was of mine and 
conjectured that my mother was a prostitute.

<character>STEWART</character>
In the English countryside many prostitutes 
decorate their rooms with festive gourds.

[Time Lapse. Bender rolls some dough with his hands.]

<character>FEMALE ANNOUNCER</character>
30 minutes to go.

[Bender sits on the dough and starts rolling it.]

<character>HIROKI</character>
Look at Bender roll that dough!

<character>TATE</character>
I've never seen such confident, powerful 
strokes of the ass!

<character>STEWART</character>
You've never seen mine!

<character>TATE</character>
(sexfully) No I haven't!

[Morbo gives him a weird look.]

[Time Lapse.]

<character>FEMALE ANNOUNCER</character>
Fifteen minutes remaining.

[Elzar gives a signal and Sal rolls a hovercrane into the studio 
carrying a huge model built from soylent green.]

<character>HIROKI</character>
The iron cook is bringing in his signature 
creation, a working pastry replica of 
downtown Venice.]

[A cameraman points a camera at the model and a shrimp rows a 
gondola down the canal singing La Donna E Mobile. In the audience 
a man walks around with a box strapped to his front with $10.00 
written in it.]

<character>MAN</character>
Commemorative turkey basters, get your 
commemorative turkey basters.

<character>FRY</character>
Yo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and 
I've tried everything.  Oh right. Never 
mind.

[Zoidberg hears the violin strains again and puts his claws to 
his head.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Oh the guilt! The unbearable guilt!

<character>FEMALE ANNOUNCER</character>
Fifteen seconds.

[Elzar arranges his food on the plates and man wheels in a rack 
of spice weasels. Elzar selects one.]

<character>ELZAR</character>
Bam!

[He takes the spice weasel off the rack and gives his food a 
blast with it.]

<character>FEMALE ANNOUNCER</character>
Ten seconds.

[Bender hammers his food and arranges it on a tray. He looks 
at it and then takes out Spargle's vial.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Master Spargle. If you can hear me up 
there in that ditch where I left you, 
this is for you.

[He pours some flavour onto the food and a gong sounds.]

<character>KOJI</character>
Time, uperuu!

[Time Lapse. A "Tasting" caption appears on the screen.]

<character>HIROKI</character>
The iron cook Neptunian has gone all 
out to please the judges. He's even 
garnished the salad with $100 bills. 
Let's see what they think.

[Elzar puts plates of food in front of Tate and Morbo and scrapes 
some into Stewart's jar.]

<character>TATE</character>
Mmm, soylent green is my kind of people!

[He eats some more. Morbo sucks up his soylent spaghetti.]

<character>MORBO</character>
Scrumptious. Morbo will store this in 
his sack for future digestion.

<character>STEWART</character>
I'm swimming in my own soylent waste. 
It's a good thing.

[The gong sounds again.]

<character>HIROKI</character>
Next, up, challenger Bender. A student 
of the legendary Hemut Spargle, Bender 
is some sort of wonderful mechanical 
man.

[Bender puts the plates in from of Tate and Morbo who don't react 
too well. He scrapes some into Stewart's jar and she completely 
disappears under it.]

<character>STEWART</character>
Ooo...delicious!

<character>TATE</character>
This food looks kind of funky, but it 
tastes kind of funkay!

<character>MORBO</character>
The challenger's ugly food has shown 
us that even hideous things can be sweet 
on the inside.

[He starts crying. Tate hugs him and pats his back.]

[Time Lapse. The caption "Judgement" appears on the screen.]

<character>HIROKI</character>
And now, judgement. The winner will 
become the new iron cook, the loser 
is doomed to scrub.  Who's confection 
achieves perfection? Who's foodstuff 
will be the good stuff?

[Leela crosses her fingers.]

<character>KOJI</character>
Challengeruu Benderuu!

[Everyone applauds.]

<character>FRY</character>
Yay!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
That's my robot! I own him!

<character>BENDER</character>
You honour me chairman Koji.

<character>KOJI</character>
Domo arigato, Mr Roboto.

<character>BENDER</character>
Chairman-san, I came here with one goal. 
To humiliate Elzar in a large stadium. 
I believe I'e done that.

[On the other side of the studio Elzar scrubs the pots and pans.]

<character>ELZAR</character>
No question.

<character>BENDER</character>
But the true Zen of flavour is not found 
in a coliseum. It is found in a small 
kitchen, with friends. That is why I 
decline the title of Iron Cook and accept 
only the lesser title of Zinc Saucier 
which I just made up. Also it comes 
with double prize money.

[Everyone cheers. But Zoidberg is not in his seat. He runs onto 
the platform next to Bender and Koji.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Wait! Everyone must know. I broke the 
Professor's bottled ship.  And what 
is worse, I framed my dearest friend 
Fry! (crying) I can never repay him 
his ten dollars. So I must take the 
only honourable path. what the killing 
myself.  Here I go already.  Huh?

<character>KOJI</character>
Oh! That sword cost 5000 dolluu!

[Zoidberg drops the sword.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Fry did it!

[He runs away, wooping.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. The crew watch the whole show 
on <character>TV</character>. Bender turns it off.]

<character>BENDER</character>
And that's how I defeated Elzar - thanks 
to Spargle's magic liquid.

<character>LEELA</character>
Yes, we were there. And we just finished 
watching it on <character>TV</character>.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Hmm. Let me see that vial Bender.  Good 
Lord! According to the spectrolizer, 
Spargle's magic ingredient was...water. 
Ordinary water!

[Everyone gasps.]

<character>HERMES</character>
No!

<character>FRY</character>
Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you 
was confidence. The confidence to be 
your best.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing 
more than a few spoonfuls of <character>LSD</character>.

[Bender takes the vial.]

<character>BENDER</character>
The important thing is, by my standards, 
I won fair and square. Now, who wants 
brunch? Cooked with plenty of..."confidence"?

<character>LEELA</character>
I'm in!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I do!

[They all cheer and the episode plays out with a riff from Cream's 
Sunshine Of Your Love.]
