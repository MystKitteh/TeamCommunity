[Opening Credits. Caption: Love It Or Shove It.]

[Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Corridor. A man attatches a "5" 
to a sign reading "Planet Express tockholders Meeting" so the 
third word reads "5tockholders."]

<character>MAN</character>
Yes, good thing I noticed the similar 
shapes.

[Cut to: Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Ballroom A. Hermes hosts 
the stockholders meeting. Present are the Planet Express crew 
and Hattie.]

[The curtain opens and he pushes him forward.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Ohh!

[The stockholders cheer.]

<character>AMY</character>
There he is!

<character>HATTIE </character>(<character>SHOUTING</character>)
Take it off!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Where am I?

<character>HERMES</character>
Move forward. Walk into the light.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh God! I'm dead. Well, no matter.  
(reading) Thank you all for coming. 
I don't recognise any of you, nor can 
I recall why I am here. Now without 
further ado, a film highlighting Planet 
Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year.

[The stockholders applaud and a film comes on showing the Planet 
Express ship flying over some water away from a sunset.]

<character>NARRATOR </character>[IN <character>FILM</character>]
Planet Express is on the move. For this 
young, hip delivery compnay, tomorrow 
is today and today is yesterday. You 
heard me.  It was a year of soaring 
profits and significant one time losses.

[The ship takes off from Amazonia and immediately crashes.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
I'll not only help you find it, I'll 
help you do more to it!

[Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Corridor. Fry and Zoidberg walk 
out of Ballroom A and Fry sees a sign outside Ballroom B.]

<character>FRY</character>
Ooo, a bot-mitzvah. Shalom hunger, shalom 
free food!

[He walks in and Zoidberg follows. A robot blocks Zoidberg's 
path.]

<character>ROBOT #1</character>
No shellfish!

[He slams the door.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
That is so unfair!

<character>PIG</character>
Tell me about it.

[Cut to: Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Ballroom B. The Jewbots 
dance around the bot-mitvah bot and Fry gets some food from the 
buffet.]

<character>FRY</character>
So what's the deal? You guys don't believe 
in Robot Jesus?

<character>ROBOT #2</character>
We believe he was built and that he 
was a very well programmed robot but 
he wasn't our Messiah.

[Cut to: Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Ballroom A. The film is 
still going on. The Planet Express ship soars into space with 
fireworks trailing behind it.]

<character>NARRATOR </character>[IN <character>FILM</character>]
And so our company flames onwards. Planet 
Express: Limitless potential, boundless 
horizons, the unstoppable juggernaut 
of the corporate universe.

[The Planet Express ship passes through a ring and forms the 
company logo. The film ends.]

<character>HERMES</character>
It's been a terrible year people. The 
company is on the verge of bankruptcy.

[The stockholders gasp.]

<character>LEELA</character>
But the movie -

<character>HERMES</character>
Was a substantial loss for the company. 
The blue slice represent s the money 
we earned from shipping packages while 
the green slice represents an $8 bank 
error in our favour.

<character>LEELA</character>
This toads the wet sprocket. What about 
our thousands of shares of stock?

<character>HERMES</character>
Worthless.

[The stockholders gasp.]

<character>BENDER </character>(<character>SHOUTING</character>)
I'll kill you!

<character>HATTIE</character>
I own one share of Planet kajiggers 
so I'm entitled to some answers. Question 
1: Why does no one visit me in my home?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip 
and cat pee.

[Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Corridor. Fry sees a sign outside 
Ballroom C for a cryogenic support group. He gasps.]

<character>FRY</character>
This is perfect for me.

[He was actually looking at the free food sign underneath. Zoidberg 
follows him in.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Question: Do you have to have been cryogenically 
frozen to get the free -  You didn't 
let me finish. I was going to say "to 
get the free food."

[Cut to: Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Ballroom C. Fry gobbles 
down the food at the buffet while the support group discusses 
things.]

<character>JOE</character>
My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.

<character>EVERYONE</character>
Hello Joe.

<character>JOE</character>
When I was frozen giant carrots ruled 
the Earth. But now they don't. It takes 
some getting used to.

[He sits down and the group applauds. Fry has sat down with a 
plate of food. Another man stands up.]

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Back in the 1980's I was the toast of 
Wall Street. I was having whiskey with 
Boesky and cookies with Milken. But 
then, I was diagnosed with terminal 
boneitis.

<character>FRY</character>
Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for 
a horrible disease.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
There was no cure at the time. One drug 
company was close but I arranged a hostile 
takeover and sold off all the assets. 
Made a cool hundred mil.  Naturally 
I froze myself until a cure was found. 
Now here I am, ready to sleaze my way 
back to the top, 80's style!

[He sits down next to Fry.]

<character>CAVEMAN</character>
As a caveman frozen in a glacier I face 
different challenges. (crying) The hardest 
thign was seeing my wife on display 
in the British Museum.

[The group murmurs.]

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Sure do! We can dance!

[He hums the Safety Dance tune and they both laugh.]

<character>FRY</character>
Y'know that dance wasn't as safe as 
they said it was.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
I tell you, two go-go 80's Reganauts 
like us, we could rule this world!

<character>FRY</character>
No question.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
If only someone would give us a shot.

<character>FRY</character>
They're scared of our raw power. Oh 
but if you want a job, I could beg everyone 
at the company where I work.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Awesome. Awesome to the max!

[Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Ballroom A. Enter Fry and That 
Guy.]

<character>HERMES</character>
And finally, the post office meter is 
for business mail only.

<character>BENDER</character>
Aw come on! I got a lot of ransom notes 
to send!

<character>HATTIE</character>
Enough talk. It's time for action. I 
move that everyone come to my apartment 
to snuggle my cat.

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Second.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Second.

<character>HATTIE</character>
I move that we vote on a new Chief Executive 
Officer and oust this old creep. And 
also that make cat smells good and is 
pretty.

[Scruffy thinks.]

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Second.

<character>HERMES</character>
Very well. I nominate the Professor.

<character>AMY</character>
Second.

<character>LEELA</character>
Second.

<character>BENDER</character>
Second.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I'm your man.

<character>LEELA</character>
I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor.

<character>HERMES</character>
Yeah the Professor!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Me!

[Hermes writes 50,000 on a chart for Farnsworth.]

<character>FRY</character>
I nominate That Guy. Not just because 
he has a suit but because he knows about 
business and stuff and he has a tie. 
My shares still count if they went 
through the washing machine right?

[Hermes starts a new chart for That Guy next to Farnsworth's 
and write 10,000 under his name.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Well, if I know anything about which 
number is bigger than the other number, 
I'd say that -

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Hold on there. Scruffy votes his 40,000 
shares for the mysterious stranger.

<character>LEELA</character>
40,000? How come you have four times 
as much stock as the rest of us?

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Scruffy believes in this company.

[He sniffs and wipes away a tear. Hermes changes That Guy's score 
to 50,000.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Then we have a tie. And in the event 
of a tie the Professor, as the current 
<character>CEO</character> remains -

<character>HATTIE</character>
I demand the floor. I may only have 
one share but I get to vote same as 
anyone. And I'm voting against the cat 
hater.  Isn't that right kitty?  Hey! 
You ate my change!

[She shakes the cat and the money inside it jingles. Hermes changes 
That Guy's score to 50,001.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Then it's settled. The new chief executive 
officer of Planet Express corporation 
is That Guy.

[That Guy hums Safety Dance.]

[Planet Express: Meeting Room.]

<character>HERMES</character>
Please welcome our new chief executive 
officer, That Guy.

[Fry applauds and hoots. The rest of the crew glare at him.]

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Let's cut to the chase. There are two 
kinds of people: sheep and sharks. Anyone 
who's a sheep is fired. Who's a sheep?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Uh excuse me? Which is the one people 
like to hug?

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Gutsy question, you're a shark. Sharks 
are winners and they don't look back 
'cause they don't have necks. Necks 
are for sheep.  I am proud to be the 
shepherd of this herd of sharks and 
I am gonna lead you to the top of this 
industry of...of...

<character>FRY </character>(<character>WHISPERING</character>)
Package delivery.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Package delviery? Oh God!  Fantastic! 
Now the first order of business is to 
blame everything on the guy before me. 
Professor?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Terrific. Question number one: What 
was your overall business plan?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Uh, um, uh business plan, uh, yes. I 
keep it here - right next to my heart.

[He opens a drawer and pulls out a file next to a jar with a 
heart in it. He hands the file to That Guy.]

<character>THAT GUY</character>
This isn't a business plan, it's an 
escape plan.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
So long suckers!

[He climbs down a ladder and runs across the hangar floor laughing 
insanely.]

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Fry, as a fellow 80's dollar jockey, 
I'm making you my new vice chairman.

[Fry cheers.]

<character>FRY</character>
I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.

<character>BENDER</character>
Ohh!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
It's the end of the line!

<character>HERMES</character>
We're ruined!

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
What fevered dream is this that bids 
to tear this company in twain?

[He leans back and starts reading National Pornographic.]

[Outside Giorgio Armonster. Exit Fry and That Guy from the shop 
sporting 80's style suits. The monster waves them off.]

<character>MONSTER</character>
Thank you come again!

<character>THAT GUY</character>
That's what I call a hostile makeover! 
Hair gel?

<character>FRY</character>
No thanks I make my own.

[He slicks his hair back.]

[Ship's Cockpit.]

<character>THAT GUY</character>
This company's gonna shoot straight 
to the top and stay there! Like Cindy 
Lauper! I ask you: Who is the number 
one delivery service on Earth?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Is it Planet Express master?

[That Guy laughs.]

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Is this guy a shark or what? Seriously 
though we stink out loud. Here's the 
big enchirito.  Mom's Friendly Delivery 
Company.

<character>HERMES</character>
We can't compete with Mom! Her company 
is big, and evil. Ours is small and 
neutral.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Switzerland is small and neutral. We're 
more like Germany; ambitious and misunderstood.

<character>AMY</character>
Look, everyone wants to be like Germany 
but do we really have the pure strength 
of will?

<character>THAT GUY</character>
I say we do! Now are we gonna let ourselves 
be beaten by an old lady?

[Zoidberg bows.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Yes my liege!

<character>FRY</character>
No we're not. And as vice chairman, 
I believe I speak for the entire board 
when I issue this challenge to Mom. 
Look at my butt!

[He presses it up against the window and cheers.]

[Cut to: Mom's Office. Mom, Walt, Larry and Igner look out the 
window.]

<character>MOM</character>
You call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit 
the retaliate button.

[Walt looks at a control panel.]

<character>WALT</character>
Uh, um, hmm lets see.

<character>MOM</character>
Any button they all retaliate!

[Walt presses a random button.]

[Cut to: Outside Mom's Building. The sign on the top of the building 
with Mom bottle-feeding a parcel like a baby suddenly turns eeevil. 
The bottle turns towards the Planet Express ship and fires lasers 
at it. The crew scream from inside and the ship flies away.]

[Madison Cube Garden. Fry and That Guy are sitting in the <character>VIP </character>
section with Zapp, Calculon, Morbo and Jackie Anderson watching 
the big ape fight. The apes fight and scream. Fry hoots.]

<character>FRY</character>
Woo yeah! Hit him hit him hit him!  
Now this is the high life! Watching 
apes mangle each other near celebrities!

<character>THAT GUY</character>
In my day we went to coke parties but 
the principle's the same.

[An ape screams and throws it's trike at Calculon.]

<character>CALCULON</character>
Get your stinkin' trike off me you damn 
dirty ape.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Listen big guy, now that you're my prod�g�, 
it's time I cut you in on the secret 
to success. Any guesses?

<character>FRY</character>
Uh, work really really hard?

<character>THAT GUY</character>
No.

<character>FRY</character>
Oh thank God!

<character>THAT GUY</character>
It's all about appearances. That's why 
its time to update our company's stodgy 
image and give it the sleek dazzling 
veneer of the 1980's!

[Planet Express: Meeting Room. Enter Fry and That Guy on rocket 
powered chairs. The rest of the crew are asleep at the table. 
Fry claps and they suddenly wake up.]

<character>FRY</character>
This company's on the fast track to 
the It List! Blast back kudos all around!

<character>LEELA</character>
Uh hello? We haven't made one delivery 
since you two took over.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Delivery has nothing to do with the 
delivery business. Image people, image! 
Scope out this new ad!

[He presses a button on the remote and an advert comes on the 
big screen. A Planet Express-ified version of Apple's 1984 ad. 
A woman runs into a building with a Planet Express package. Mom 
is on a huge screen.]

<character>MOM </character>[ON AD]
We are all one. With one mind, one purpose 
and one act. Our enemy shall be eaten 
by scorpions!  We shall bow down and 
worship to ourselves.  We shall prevail!

[The package hits the screen and it explodes. A man in the audience 
stands up.]

<character>MAN </character>[ON AD]
Hey! We were watching that!

[The scene freezes and a new Planet Express logo appears on the 
screen � la the FedEx logo only this time it's PlanEx.]

<character>LEELA</character>
That was terrible! People won't even 
know what we do.

<character>BENDER</character>
I don't even know what we do. Nah just 
kidding, what are like a bus or something?

<character>LEELA</character>
Did you approve that awful ad Fry?

<character>FRY</character>
Yes I did Leels! And I'll tell you why. 
Because it grows the brand.

[That Guy pats his shoulder.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh Lord!

[Zoidberg growls.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
This company's circling the drain I 
tell you. I'd sell my stock right now 
for a sangwich!

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Sold!

[He gets a sandwich out of a Miami Vice lunchbox and hands it 
to Zoidberg.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
A complete sangwich?  You got fleeced! 
I would have settled for a hard roll 
with ketchup inside!

[Mom's Office. She runs on a running machine while looking at 
Mentor magazine and Prot�g� magazine. That Guy and Fry are on 
each cover.]

<character>MOM</character>
What is this moose drip?  The new delivery 
kings? I'm sick of hearing about those 
turtle squirts!

<character>IGNER</character>
But they're kings mommy!

<character>MOM</character>
Jam a bastard in it you crap!

[She slaps them.]

[Elzar's Fine Cuisine: Private Dining Room. That Guy and Fry 
are seated in a cosy little room.]

<character>ELZAR</character>
Enjoy our private dining room folks! 
This is where we serve our richest most 
successful chumps!

<character>FRY</character>
Tonight, that's us!

<character>THAT GUY</character>
What have you got that's really overpriced?

<character>ELZAR</character>
Everything.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Bring me that.

<character>FRY</character>
Make it two. And a glass of all your 
water.

[Elzar leaves and That guy pulls out some card from his jacket.]

<character>THAT GUY</character>
OK, lets work on your execu-speak. I'm 
worried about "blank."

<character>FRY</character>
Don't you worry about "blank" let me 
worry about "blank."

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Very good. I also would have accepted 
"Blank? Blank?! you're not looking at 
the big picture!"

[Mom coughs from behind Fry and he and That Guy look up.]

<character>FRY </character>(<character>WEAKLY</character>)
What a pleasant surprise!

<character>MOM</character>
Shut up booger blaster! It's time the 
three of us had a talk.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
I'll handle this Fry. You get back to 
the farm, shift some paradigms, revolutionise 
outside the box.

<character>FRY</character>
I'm on it. But if you need me you know 
where I'll be.

[He walks through a door to the wine cellar and falls down the 
steps.]

[Planet Express: Fry's Office. Fry irons his tie.]

[Enter Leela, Bender, Hermes, Zoidberg, Amy, Scruffy and Farnsworth.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Fry we're worried about Planet Express.

<character>FRY</character>
Don't you worry about Planet Express. 
Let me worry about blank!

<character>HERMES</character>
That Guy is nothing but a flashy con 
man! And you've been hypnotised by his 
swinging blogney!

<character>LEELA</character>
You've changed Fry.

<character>FRY</character>
What? I haven't changed.  Suz? Have 
I changed?

<character>SUZ </character>[ON <character>INTERCOM</character>]
No sir Mr Fry.

<character>FRY</character>
Thanks doll.

<character>LEELA</character>
I don't care what Ms Johnson says, Thst 
Guy's turning this place into some kind 
of...business.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
This isn't a business, I've always thought 
of it as more of a source of cheap labour. 
Like a family.

<character>FRY</character>
You're right Professor. We might not 
be a traditional family like the Murphy's 
next door or the lesbian coven across 
the street but we are a family, and 
That Guy understands that.

[That Guy appears on a screen.]

<character>THAT GUY </character>[ON <character>SCREEN</character>]
Everyone's fired and we're out of business.

[Everyone gasps.]

<character>AMY</character>
Oh no.

<character>HERMES</character>
How?

<character>THAT GUY </character>[ON <character>SCREEN</character>]
I'm gonna sell Planet Express to Mom 
so she can gut the company and eliminate 
us as competitors.

<character>MOM </character>[ON <character>SCREEN</character>]
Don't let the door hit you on your way 
out. 'Cause I don't want ass prints 
on my new door!

[The screen cuts out and the ex-crew glare at Fry. He presses 
the launch button on his chair and it takes off, struggles, and 
crashes down again. Everyone glares harder. Fry presses the intercom.]

<character>FRY</character>
Uh Ms Johnson? Please bring in some 
more chair fuel.

[Planet Express: Locker Area. Everyone clears out their lockers.]

<character>FRY</character>
I had no idea the company would be sold. 
I was just an innocent suck up. You've 
gotta believe me!

[Leela slams her door shut.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Just leave us alone and let us clear 
out our lockers.

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah.

[He slams Hermes' door shut and chuckles. Amy clears out her 
locker and puts her stuff in a box a man is holding for her.]

<character>AMY </character>(<character>CRYING</character>)
It's so sad, where will I go? What will 
I do?

<character>LACKEY</character>
You have Mrs Darlinghaven's cotillion 
at 7 ma'am.

<character>AMY </character>(<character>CRYING</character>)
Oh. That'll be fun.

[Planet Express: Fry's Office. Fry sighs and presses the intercom 
button.]

<character>FRY</character>
Ms Johnson, you've never lied to me. 
Am I still a good person?

<character>SUZ </character>[ON <character>INTERCOM</character>]
I don't know sir. I'm a program built 
into the intercom.

<character>FRY</character>
I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, 
sometime, for some reason. I'll block 
this takeover!

<character>SUZ </character>[ON <character>INTERCOM</character>]
Mr Fry, your 2 o'clock magician is here.

<character>FRY</character>
Believe it or not, I have more important 
things to do today than laugh and clap 
my hands.  Reschedule.

[The Planet Express ship flies towards the Intergalactic Stock 
Exchange and the huge Momcorp ship follows.]

[Cut to: Intergalactic Stock Exchange. People and robots shout, 
buying and selling stock.]

<character>BROKERBOT #1</character>
Sell 100 soylent beans!

<character>BROKERBOT #2</character>
Buy 1000 cornbellies!

<character>BROKERBOT #3</character>
200 cans of whoop-ass!

<character>BROKERBOT #1</character>
Three big bags of trash!

[Everything goes silent and a huge holographic head appears in 
the middle of the room.]

<character>JOR</character>-EL
Attention please. The takeover of PlanEx 
Corp by Mom's Friendly Company will 
take place in the business centre in 
10 minutes. I am Jor-El! Master of scheduling!

[Intergalactic Stock Exchange Business Centre. Hundreds of people 
fill the room. The Planet Express employees sit angrily next 
to Mom's sons.]

<character>THAT GUY</character>
OK, we've got the hot tub hot, the wine 
cooler's cool. It's Hammer time!

[The Planet Express employees boo him.]

<character>BENDER</character>
You suck!

[Mom takes the stand.]

<character>MOM</character>
According to regulations, both companies 
must approve the takeover. Planet Express 
shareholders, cast your votes.

<character>HERMES</character>
Great Bonda of Uganda! We can vote against 
it!

[Everyone cheers.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I'll vote it down like a raise for school 
teachers!

[They all vote No and a chart ppears behind That Guy and Mom. 
49% have voted for No. That Guy votes Yes and the graph changes 
to 51% for Yes. Planet Express gasps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
What the?

<character>HATTIE</character>
How the?

<character>AMY</character>
Oh no.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
I neglected to mention that the shares 
I bought from Dr Zoidberg gave me majority 
control.

<character>LEELA</character>
Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?

<character>HERMES</character>
The shares were worthless and he kept 
asking for toilet paper.

<character>MOM</character>
And now if Momcorp shareholders will 
cast their ballots.

[She selects Yes and the Momcorp vote goes up to 99.7% Yes. Walt 
votes Yes and it changes to 99.8%. Larry votes and it changes 
to 99.9%. Igner has a little trouble.]

<character>IGNER</character>
Um...uh... Uh, the ballot was confusing.

<character>MOM</character>
How about a hand recount?

<character>IGNER</character>
<character>OK</character>.  Ow!

<character>MOM</character>
The takeover of Planet Express is approved.

[The Planet Express crew boos.]

<character>AMY</character>
This stinks!

<character>LACKEY</character>
Madam is outraged.

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Security, I want that bunch of rowdies 
out of here.

[The securitybots lift the crew out of their seats.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hold on a minute!

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Hey! Hey!

[The securitybots take the crew away leaving only a sleeping 
Farnsworth and Hattie in their seats.]

<character>MOM</character>
Momcorp will now purchase all outstanding 
shares of Planet Express at the current 
market price which is...

[On the screen behind her <character>PLNX 107</character> appears.]

<character>JOR</character>-EL
107.

[Cut to: Outside Business Centre. The securitybots drop the crew 
onto the floor.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!

<character>LEELA</character>
They are? Oh my God! I'm a millionaire! 
Suddenly I have an opinion about that 
capital gains tax!

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah all right!

<character>AMY</character>
I'm even richer!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Oh! I have no shares!  Wait! My sangwich! 
Has it also appreciated in value?  Please 
oh please!

<character>HERMES</character>
You didn't even refrigerate it you spineless 
lobster!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
You had to drag spines into this!

[He cries. Fry appears on the overhead monitors. He clears his 
throat.]

<character>FRY </character>[ON <character>SCREEN</character>]
As vice chairman of Planet Express I'd 
like to say a few words. There comes 
a time for every man who becomes rich 
and deserts his friends, when he goes 
back how it was. For me, that time is 
now....

[Cut to: Intergalactic Stock Exchange Business Centre. Fry turns 
to That Guy.]

<character>FRY</character>
...So I ask you, as a friend, won't 
you stop this deal?

<character>THAT GUY</character>
Fry I'm an 80's guy. Friendship means 
to me that for two bucks I'd beat you 
with a pool cue 'til you got detached 
retinas. The deal will go ahead as - 
My bones!

[The crowd gasps.]

<character>FRY</character>
Oh my God! His boneitis!

<character>THAT GUY</character>
I was so busy being an 80's guy, I forgot 
to cure it.  My only regret is...that 
I have...boneitis!

[He stops twisting.]

<character>FRY</character>
He's dead.

[The crowd gasps.]

<character>MOM</character>
Pry out his fillings, feed him to the 
jackals and lets get on with the sale.

<character>FRY</character>
I don't think so. 'Cause as vice chairman 
of the company I gain voting control 
of his shares.

<character>MOM</character>
Don't be a fool you idiot!

<character>FRY</character>
I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy 
was the greatest businessman that ever 
lived and before his mysterious death 
he taught me everything he knew.  But 
some things I had to learn myself.  
I learned that money is fine but in 
the end what counts is people... ...People 
you love... ...You can't put a price 
on that... So I'm giving up control 
of the company... ...to a man of enourmous 
experience... ...Professor... ...Hubert 
Farnsworth.

[Farnsworth is still asleep but is now wearing a sleeping cap 
and bunny slippers. He wakes up.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Oh uh what? I'm awake, I'm awake!

[The stock price goes haywire. Tape falls from the ceiling an 
the Planet Express crew slide down on it.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Fry, stop doing the right thing you 
jerk!

<character>LEELA</character>
Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna 
be filthy stinking rich!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Trust me two out of three doesn't cut 
it!

<character>FRY</character>
You mean you'd rather be rich than work 
together?

<character>LEELA</character>
Hell yeah!

<character>FRY</character>
In my whole life this company was the 
only place I ever really felt at home. 
If being millionaires is more important 
to you than our...

<character>BENDER</character>
It is!

<character>FRY</character>
...friendship, then I'll sell Planet 
Express, for you.

<character>HATTIE</character>
Millionaires nothing! The stock's only 
worth three kajiggers!

[The crew mumble.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh come on!

<character>HERMES</character>
My Jah! It's worth less now than when 
it was worthless!

<character>FRY</character>
It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what 
I do! The deal is off!

[He selects no and the Planet Express vote changes to 100% for 
No.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy 
portfolio pays off for the hungry investor! 
Oh! I'm ruined.  Why? Why?

<character>FRY</character>
Look, so we're not millionaires. At 
least we all still get to work together!

<character>BENDER</character>
Shut your fat mouth!

[The crew walk out muttering.]

<character>FRY </character>(<character>SHOUTING</character>)
See you guys Monday!

<character>THE END</character>
