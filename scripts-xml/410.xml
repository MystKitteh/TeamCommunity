[Opening Credits. Caption: Scratch Here To Reveal Prize.]

[Planet Express: Lounge. Fry looks out of the window through 
a pair of binoculars. Leela, Bender and Farnsworth sit at the 
table.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh put down the binoculars Fry. The 
wall of that strip club isn't going 
to collapse twice in one day.

<character>FRY</character>
I know, and I've grown to accept that. 
Now I'm more interested in that new 
pizza parlour across the street. Kinda 
makes me pine for my days as a pizza 
delivery boy. "Here's you pizza," I'd 
say. "I didn't order any," they'd say. 
And then I'd be off to my next adventure.

<character>LEELA</character>
That story stunk. Hand me the binoculars. 
I think the owner is from Cygnus 5.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Cygnoids? On our block? Flying foo! 
They should go back where they came 
from.

<character>LEELA</character>
Professor please. Society's never gonna 
make any progress until we all learn 
to pretend to like each other. Now lets 
go over there and make these hideous 
strangers feel welcome.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
No.

[Family Bros. Pizza. The owners are a man and woman. They looks 
like giant fat insects with little antennae and thoraxes, but 
they have the same limbs as humans; two arms, two legs, four 
fingers on each hand. They are dress in the same way as some 
Italian immigrants and have vaguely Italian accents. They stand 
in the middle of their restaurant awaiting customers.]

<character>CYGNOID WOMAN</character>
You sure about these chairs? Guidebook 
says human legs bend down at knee.

[The points at the chairs which have an extra part on the seat 
that bends up.]

<character>CYGNOID MAN</character>
It's OK Mama, anyone complains, I bend 
legs up for free.  Ooo customers!  Welcome 
to Earth pizza store. Here, sit, I bend 
knees for you.

[Bender sits down and the Cygnoid bends his legs up.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ooo that's a-comfy!

[Fry and Leela sit down themselves.]

<character>CYGNOID MAN</character>
OK, now, what kind of pizza goes in 
you?  Silt? Asbestos? We got guano - 
very fresh!

<character>FRY</character>
Uh, hmm, do you have any food?

<character>CYGNOID MAN</character>
Here, try a deep dish pizza.  Contains 
four kind of things.

[The Cygnoid woman cuts the "pizza" and some blue ooze oozes 
out. Fry and Leela reluctantly taste it and spit it out.]

<character>LEELA</character>
I don't mean to offend but this tastes 
like vomit.

<character>CYGNOID WOMAN</character>
(happy) Thank you.

<character>LEELA</character>
No, actually I did mean to offend a 
little. This is awful.

[The Cygnoids shout at each other in Cygnoid and then burst into 
tears.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hey hey, what's wrong? Was it something 
Leela said?

<character>CYGNOID WOMAN</character>
(crying) We come to Earth to start new 
life. Raise fat spoiled Earth kids, 
hang many underwear from Earth clothesline, 
live Earthican dream.

[They cry more.]

<character>FRY</character>
Aww, don't cry foreign people. I used 
to work in a pizzeria and as soon as 
I stop hallucinating and blasting puke, 
I'm gonna teach you to sell pizza - 
Earth style!

<character>CYGNOID WOMAN</character>
Oh thank you magic biped!

[She kisses his feet.]

<character>CYGNOID MAN</character>
You save us sir, if we cannot make Earth 
pizza our dream will die. Just like 
rats we crushed to make the wine.

[Fry spits out the wine all over Bender's face and Bender spits 
it back.]

[Time Lapse. Fry teaches the Cygnoids all about pizzeria's.]

<character>FRY</character>
For starters, only use quality ingredients. 
Case in point: No more live bees.  Oregano 
works equally well. And when you put 
pizzas in the oven, don't get in with 
them.

[He opens the oven door and a Cygnoid inside immediately closes 
it.]

<character>CYGNOID #2</character>
Hey, ocupado!

<character>FRY</character>
Most important of all is the big screen 
<character>TV</character>. Human families need a TV when they're 
eating so they don't have to talk to 
each other.  Ah, the Earthican pasttime, 
blernsball!

[The pitcher pitches the ball and Bob Uecker commentates.]

<character>UECKER </character>[ON TV]
Mulligan drives the ball, it's going, 
going and caught by the shortstop. Man 
I haven't seen play this bad since the 
days of Bob Uecker! This is Bob Uecker 
saying thanks for watching!

[The Cygnoids watch in puzzlement.]

<character>CYGNOID MAN</character>
Mets? Shortstop? Pinching the hitter? 
I don't understand this blernsball.

<character>FRY</character>
Well if you're going to be Earthicans 
we'll have to teach you. How about your 
pizzeria plays a game against Planet 
Express? Oh but you'll need nine players.

<character>CYGNOID WOMAN</character>
No problem!

[She shouts in Cygnoid and seven Cygnoids climb out of the oven.]

<character>CYGNOID #2</character>
Play the ball!

[Central Park. People dine at the Cavern On The Green cafï¿½ and 
a dog catches what it thinks is a frisbee. The frisbee opens 
and some little aliens shout at the dog. On the blernsball pitch 
the teams get ready for their game. Farnsworth doesn't play and 
shouts from the stand.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(shouting) Go team! Beat those no good 
Cygnoids! Show them they stink at a 
game they've never played before!

[Leela is the pitcher and the Cygnoid man goes up to bat.]

<character>CYGNOID MAN</character>
Ah, this is why I love Earth! Beautiful 
star brightened day, friendly blernsball 
game with chum pals! So pleasant for 
everybody.

[Leela throws the ball and it hits him on the head and knocks 
him over.]

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Hit by a pitch, take your base.

[Leela gasps.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(shouting) Sorry about that, I guess 
I needed a few more warm-up pitches.

[Another Cygnoid steps up.]

<character>BENDER</character>
No batter! No batter!  No batter anymore.

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Take your base.

<character>LEELA</character>
(shouting) I didn't mean to hit you, 
I have some trouble with depth perception.

<character>CYGNOID #2</character>
Yeah, me too now.

[A third Cygnoid goes to bat.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey batter batter batter! Hey batter 
batter batter! Hey batter batter!  Duck!

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Take your base.

[A crowd of people gathers around and starts watching the game. 
Another Cygnoid goes to bat.]

<character>CYGNOID #3</character>
Please lady, I want to live. Can I use 
bat to protect head?

[Leela's ball hits him.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Apparently not.

[The crowd applauds.]

<character>MAN</character>
Check out the one eyed bean machine!

<character>CYGNOID MAN</character>
Hooray! I make a score point!

[The Planet Express team gathers around Leela.]

<character>FRY</character>
Leela, you beaned a run-in. You'd better 
let me pitch.

<character>LEELA</character>
But I've got a no-hitter going.  You're 
right. Here.

[She throws the ball at his face. The crowd cheers.]

<character>RANDY</character>
Don't take her out, she's a firecracker!

[Leela walks into the Commissioner of the <character>URFL</character>.]

<character>COMMISSIONER</character>
Excuse me, I'd like to talk to you.

<character>LEELA</character>
Am I under arrest?

<character>BENDER</character>
Wait I know you. You're the sleabag 
who owns the Ultimate Robot Fighting 
League.

<character>COMMISSIONER</character>
Not anymore. Now I'm the sleazebag who 
owns the New New York Mets.

<character>LEELA</character>
The Mets? Those bums are worse than 
me.

<character>COMMISSIONER</character>
Close to it. But they don't draw a crowd 
like you. Which is why I wanna sign 
you to the team.

[Leela gasps.]

<character>LEELA</character>
You mean I'd be the first woman ever 
to play major league blernsball?

<character>COMMISSIONER</character>
Well yeah but basically you'd just be 
a publicity stunt. I figured a one-eyed 
lady skull buster might bring out the 
freakshow crowd.

<character>LEELA</character>
Wow, the first woman ever to play major 
league blernsball.

<character>COMMISSIONER</character>
Again yeah, but basically you'd -

[Leela jumps into the air.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Yippee!

[Planet Express: Lounge. Leela is kitted out in her Mets uniform 
that looks like the one from the 1980's and 7/8 is printed on 
the back. She turns around to the rest of the crew.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Ta-da! The first woman ever to play 
major league blernsball. How do I look?

<character>HERMES</character>
Like a sexy Yogi Berra!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Why is your number seven-eight's?

<character>LEELA</character>
All the whole numbers have been retired.

<character>FRY</character>
Wow, I must say I'm impressed. You look 
just like a ball player. Can I pat you 
on the butt?

<character>LEELA</character>
Fry I'm a professional athlete! So go 
ahead.

[Fry stops halfway.]

<character>FRY</character>
Ohh, now I'm too nervous.

[Shea Stadium. The Mets play the Swedish Meatballs. The Mets 
are at 0 while the Swedish Meatballs are ahead at 15.]

[Cut to: Commentary Box.]

<character>UECKER</character>
Well folks it's only the fifth inning 
but the Swedes have already turned this 
one into a laffer. And that's with two 
F's. The crowd is pouring out of the 
stadium LA style.

[Cut to: Bleachers. The Mets fans start to leave.]

[Cut to: Mets' Bench. Leela sits on the bench watching the game 
with the manager. Enter the Commissioner.]

<character>COMMISSIONER</character>
Skipper, we're losing the crowd. Put 
it our new novelty act - Leela.

[Leela gasps. The skipper kicks the ground.]

<character>SKIPPER</character>
Darn it! I already put in the circus 
clown.

[Behind them the clown cartwheels across the pitch and honks 
a horn.]

<character>COMMISSIONER</character>
Yeah but he bunted. Clowns are only 
funny when they swing away.

[Cut to: Pitch.]

[Leela walks out onto the pitch.]

[Cut to: Bleachers. The leaving crowd doesn't react.]

[The crowd turns around in curiosity. A woman cheers Leela.]

<character>WOMAN</character>
Woo! Come on! Throw like a girl!

[The Planet Express crew cheer.]

<character>FRY</character>
(shouting) Go Leela!

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Come on girl!

<character>AMY</character>
(shouting) Too much eyeliner!

[Cut to: Pitch. Leela stands ready to throw the ball and a batter 
takes his position.]

<character>UECKER</character>
(voice-over) This is history in the 
making folks. Bjornson steps up to the 
plate and Leela delivers.

[Leela throws the ball and hits Bjornson in the face, knocking 
him over.]

[Cut to: Bleachers. The crowd gasps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Bullseye!

[Cut to: Pitch. Bjornson gets up and staggers away.]

<character>UECKER</character>
(voice-over) Ooo! An inauspicious start 
for the career of the first woman blernsballer. 
An inauspicious continuation for the 
career of the first woman blernsballer.

[Leela kicks the ground in frustration. The crowd chuckles. A 
man dusts the batter off and the batter hands him some cash and 
leaves. Another batter steps up.]

[Cut to: Bleachers.]

<character>CROWD</character>
(chanting) Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! 
Bean! Bean! Bean...

[Cut to: Pitch. Leela throws again, the ball curls around the 
back of the player and knocks him out from behind. The crowd 
cheers.]

[Cut to: Commentary Box.]

<character>UECKER</character>
Ouch! It's a three bean-ball salad. 
The Mets fans love it though and who 
can blame them? They haven't had much 
to cheer about this year -

[The ball flies up to the box and smashes Uecker's jar. The crowd 
cheers.]

[<character>NNY</character> Mets Locker Room. The male players wander around with black 
bars over their unmentionables. Leela sits sadly on a bench but 
the Commissioner doesn't seem to notice.]

<character>COMMISSIONER</character>
Kid that was great! You got us more 
publicity than a cowboy in a shark tank. 
Poor Tex, he was quite a shark.

[Enter Bender dressed in a grooby suit, shades and a headset 
phone. The trips ocver the wire from the black bar generator 
and pulls the plug from the socket. The black bars around the 
players go down and they cover themselves.]

<character>MAN #1</character>
Hey!

<character>MAN #2</character>
Hey!

<character>MAN #3</character>
C'mon!

[Another man looks around and throws his hands in the air.]

<character>MAN #4</character>
I win!

<character>BENDER</character>
Oop! Sorry.

[He plugs the plug back in and the black bars reappear.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender, how did you get in here?

<character>LEELA</character>
Since when are you my agent?

[Bender's phone rings.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Quiet, call coming in.  Yeees...? A 
big endorsement deal for Leela? How 
much...? Hey! You put a one and two 
zeroes in front of that or we pass...! 
Deal!

[He hangs up.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Bender that's great! How much did you 
get me?

<character>BENDER</character>
(impressed) One hundred dollars.

[Ancestor & Sons Ad Agency. Leela stands behind a camera in front 
of a backdrop. She holds a tin of beans and reads off an autocue.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(reading) As a pitcher, I serve up plenty 
of bean-balls, so I know good beans 
when I see them. Bean-Bay Beans - they're 
the beaniest!

[She smiles weakly.]

<character>DIRECTOR</character>
Cut!

[Shea Stadium. The Mets play the Pituitary Giants with the score 
17-2 to the Giants.]

[Cut to: Bleachers. Fans have set up Leela's Bean Counter. A 
woman hangs a fourth huge picture of a bean over the railings.]

<character>UECKER</character>
(voice-over) In very short order Leela 
has become a fan favourite.

[Cut to: Pitch. Leela knocks over another player and some paramedics 
drag him into an ambulance. The ambulance moves around the pitch 
to first base. There are three other ambulances moving from base 
to base.]

[<character>NNY</character> Mets Locker Room. Leela dresses. Enter Bender.]

<character>BENDER</character>
You're the best babe!  Hang on call 
comin' in.  What's that...? Hey you 
put a one and two zeroes in front of 
that or we pass...! Deal!

[He hangs up.]

<character>LEELA</character>
So what did you get me?

<character>BENDER</character>
(impressed) A thousand and one pesos!

[Ancestor & Sons Ad Agency. Leela shoots another bean advert 
but this time in Spanish.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Yo soy muy malo en lanzar, pero yo soy 
muy bueno en comer frijoles. Come los 
Bean Bay frijoles, los frijoles de los 
reyes.

<character>DIRECTOR</character>
Cut! OK, now do one with bean suit on!

[A man holds up a huge bean suit with a face wearing a Mets blernsball 
cap.]

[Outside Family Bros. Pizza. The Cygnoids have strung a banner 
over the doorway reading Leela Autograph Session - Bring Money. 
A line of people has formed outside.]

[Cut to: Family Bros. Pizza. Leela is sat dressed in her Mets 
uniform at a table at the far end of the room signing books while 
the Cygnoids sell pizza to her fans. Fry leans against the counter 
with a smile on his face.]

<character>CYGNOID MAN</character>
Leela really bringing in the customers.

<character>CYGNOID WOMAN</character>
This keep up we need to buy second sauce 
toilet.

[A little girl stands in front of Leela holding a magazine.]

<character>GIRL</character>
When I grow up I want to injure men 
by throwing stuff at them just like 
you Leela! Will you sign my magazine?

[She hands her a copy of Sports Illustrated with a picture of 
Leela on the cover and the caption "Leela's Beans: The Mets' 
Magical Fruit."]

<character>LEELA</character>
Aww, sure thing sweetie. Who should 
I make it out to?

<character>GIRL</character>
Well, uh...to eBay?

<character>LEELA</character>
That's a popular name today. Little 
"e" big "B"?

[The girl nods and smiles, Leela signs the magazine and the girl 
takes it and leaves. Another girl hands Leela a magazine. Bender 
chuckles and presses some buttons on a calculator.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Five bucks an autograph, 200 fans. Add 
a one and two zeros in front of that 
and we got ourselves a wad!

<character>LEELA</character>
I'm not doing this for the wad. I'm 
doing it for all the struggling female 
athletes who need a role model.

[The woman who cheered Leela from the crowd in her first blernsball 
game steps forward.]

<character>WOMAN</character>
Yeah, a role model in how to stink!

<character>LEELA</character>
What? Who are you?

<character>WOMAN</character>
Jackie Anderson. I'm on the blernsball 
team at <character>NNYU</character> and I was hoping to get 
to play in the majors soon.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, following in my footsteps?

<character>JACKIE</character>
Pft, God forbid! Your little freakshow 
is making it impossible for real female 
ball players to be taken seriously. 
I hope you're proud of yourself.

[She leaves. Leela's lip wobbles and a tear trickles down her 
face. Bender turns to the crowd.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Alright shows over no refunds, you heard 
the robot get out!

[Planet Express: Lounge. Leela, still in her uniform, sits on 
the couch with the rest of the crew sat and standing around her.]

<character>LEELA</character>
I'm a fool. The fans haven't been cheering 
for me, they've been cheering at me.

<character>AMY</character>
Don't be upset Leela. You, um...you 
look really cute in your uniform.

<character>LEELA</character>
(crying) That's what makes it so sad. 
I thought I was doing something heroic.

<character>BENDER</character>
You are. What about that little girl 
you visited in the hospital? You know 
the one I mean? The one who died?

<character>LEELA</character>
You're right. I can't let people down 
anymore. As God as my witness, I vow 
to earn the respect of girls and women 
everywhere. I will become the best blernsball 
player of all time.

[Hermes clears his throat. He is sat at the table looking at 
a computer.]

<character>HERMES</character>
That's statistically impossible. In 
77 innings you haven't gotten a single 
out. At this rate, you're sure to go 
down as the worst blernsball player 
of all time.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh. Then I have a new vow. I solemnly 
swear that I will become not the worst 
blernsball player of all time.

[She thumps her glove, misses, and punches Farnsworth in the 
face. Bender peers over his shades.]

[Blernsball Hall Of Fame. Enter Fry, Leela and Bender. They walk 
past exhibits such as the first ball hit into orbit, Mark McGwire's 
bicep and the 2927 Yankees' heads all crammed into one jar. Fry 
points at a display.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hey look! The player's who broke the 
various colour barriers!

[In the display case is a green alien, an orange alien a purple 
alien and racially superior alien from the Star Trek episode 
Let That Be Your Last Battlefield.]

<character>BENDER</character>
When will Man learn that all races are 
equally inferior to robots?

[Cut to: Worst Player In History Exhibit. The trio walk into 
a small room. There is a hologram of a blernsball player sat 
on a chair surrounded by photo's of his "triumphs."]

<character>LEELA</character>
Ah, here we are - the worst player in 
history. If I can be just a little better 
than him I can slink away with my head 
held high.

[Bender reads something.]

<character>BENDER</character>
It says he once struck out when his 
tongue got stuck to an unusually cold 
bat.

[Fry looks at a photo.]

<character>FRY</character>
And here he is trying to make a catch 
with an oven mit.

<character>LEELA</character>
It's even a crummy hologram.

[She knocks the hologram's head. It moves.]

<character>AARON JR</character>
I'm not a hologram, though I am crummy. 
Hank Aaron <character>XXIV</character>.

[Leela shakes his hand.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hank Aaron <character>XXIV</character>? How could you play 
so blowfully? The original Hank Aaron 
was great!

[A voice comes from behind them. The original Hank Aaron's head 
in a jar.]

<character>AARON SR</character>
No I was better than great. I was the 
home run king!

<character>BENDER</character>
Neat!

[He takes a photo.]

<character>LEELA</character>
So Hank - the bad Hank, just how blowful 
were you?

<character>AARON JR</character>
Well, I have a low batting average.

<character>AARON SR</character>
Low? It was zero you fungo! You went 
your whole career without getting a 
hit.

<character>FRY</character>
Leela could beat that. She's pitched 
her whole career without getting an 
out.

[Aaron Sr laughs.]

<character>AARON SR</character>
You stink lady! Hey Junior, she belongs 
in the exhibit instead of you.

<character>AARON JR</character>
Forget it. This job's too cushy to give 
up.  Aah Wade Boggs, goes down smooth!

<character>LEELA</character>
Look, I don't wanna be in this exhibit. 
That's why I need your help - so I can 
be one tiny iota less pathetic than 
you.

<character>AARON JR</character>
Oh I can't help you play better than 
Tiny Iota, that guy was great! But I'll 
teach you everything I know.

[Central Park. Leela stands on a pitcher's mound holding a blernsball, 
Aaron Jr holds a bat and Fry is backstop.]

<character>AARON JR</character>
OK, let's see what you can do.

<character>BENDER</character>
One thing she can do is lodge a ball 
in the depth centre of your brain. You 
better get a batting helmet.

[Aaron takes Bender's head off and uses it as a helmet. He lifts 
Bender's teeth so he can see.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(quietly) Alright, low and away!

[She throws the ball and knocks Aaron down. Bender picks his 
head up and staggers around disorientated.]

<character>AARON JR</character>
OK try it again but this time keep your 
eye off the ball.

<character>LEELA</character>
You mean "keep your eye on the ball"?

<character>AARON JR</character>
Hey lady, which one of us is in the 
hall of fame?

[He holds up the bat. Fry whispers to him.]

<character>FRY</character>
(whispering) Psst, you're holding the 
bat upside down.

<character>AARON JR</character>
Just pitch the ball.

<character>LEELA</character>
OK, eye off the ball.

[She throws the ball without looking at it, Aaron swings, misses 
and Fry catches the ball.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Strike!

<character>FRY</character>
Hooray!

<character>AARON JR</character>
You did it Leela!

<character>LEELA</character>
I didn't hit the batter! For once I 
was pitching and not just belly-itching!

<character>AARON JR</character>
Oh you got that too? I think there's 
a rash goin' around.

[He scratches his stomach.]

[Outside Fenway Park. On the wall outside is a sign saying Home 
Of The Green Monster.]

[Cut to: Pitch. The Green Monster plays the blernsball tune.]

[Cut to: Commentary Box.]

<character>UECKER</character>
Welcome to Fenway Park, home of the 
Boston Poindexters where the Mets close 
out a season that'll rank among mankind's 
most awful crimes.

[Cut to: Family Bros. Stand. The Cygnoids sell pizza to blernsball 
fans. Fry smiles.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hey! You opened a franchise!

<character>CYGNOID WOMAN</character>
Yes. Our biggest seller is Leela's Bean 
Pizza. Six kinds of beans, plus several 
things that look like beans.

[Fishy Joe eats a slice.]

<character>FISHY JOE</character>
Beans huh? Mmm, this is great! How to 
you make the crust so fizzy?

<character>CYGNOID MAN</character>
Ah-ah-ah! Ancient Cygnoid secret!

<character>CYGNOID WOMAN</character>
My husband, some hotshot! Here's his 
ancient Cygnoid secret!  Live hornets! 
We smush them right into dough!

<character>FISHY JOE</character>
I don't care if there's horse manure 
in it!

<character>CYGNOID MAN</character>
That's a-good!

<character>FISHY JOE</character>
I wanna buy this franchise. How does 
$100,000 sounds?

<character>CYGNOID MAN</character>
Forget it, we come to Earth to make 
pizza not money!

<character>CYGNOID WOMAN</character>
No Blek! Other way around!

<character>CYGNOID MAN</character>
Oh right, offer accepted!

[He takes the cheque and Fry, Amy, Hermes and the Cygnoid woman 
cheer.]

[Cut to: Commentary Box.]

<character>UECKER</character>
Well fans Boston's turning the last 
game into a real squeeeker! And that's 
with three "e's"! Two men on and they're 
down to their last out.

[Cut to: Met's Bench. Leela is sat on the bench while the manager 
watches the game.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Come on skipper, it's my last chance 
to prove I'm not the worst player ever. 
Please put me in.

<character>SKIPPER</character>
No. We're actually winning this game. 
You only go in as a joke when we're 
eight runs behind. Or when our other 
pitchers sneak out early to beat the 
traffic.  (shouting) Come on! Lets see 
some fundamentals out there!  And not 
clown fundamentals.

[Cut to: Pitch. A Boston player hits the ball and it bounces 
over to the clown. Instead of throwing it to another player he 
throws a pie instead.]

[Cut to: Met's Bench. The skipper kicks the ground.]

<character>SKIPPER</character>
Aw, darn, darn it! Now the bases are 
loaded. Isn't there a man on this team 
who can get one more out?

<character>LEELA</character>
I can.

<character>SKIPPER</character>
I repeat: Isn't there a man on this 
team on this -

<character>LEELA</character>
I've been training with Hank Aaron.

[The skipper turns around.]

<character>SKIPPER</character>
You've been training with the Hank Aaron?

<character>LEELA</character>
I've been training with a Hank Aaron.

<character>SKIPPER</character>
Alright then. Get in there and pitch 
like you've never pitched like you before!

[Leela runs onto the pitch.]

[Cut to: Pitch. The Mets players' jaws drop and they hold their 
hands to their heads.]

[The crowd cheers.]

[Cut to: Bleachers.]

<character>CROWD</character>
(chanting) Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean! Bean!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(shouting) Go Leela!

<character>AMY</character>
(shouting) Come on Leela!

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Put it right down the pike!

<character>FRY</character>
(shouting) Strike him out Leela! Do 
it for the hundreds of women everywhere!

[Cut to: Pitch. While the crowd continues chanting "bean" the 
Boston skipper takes a batter out and replaces him.]

[The crowd gasps as Jackie steps up to bat.]

[Cut to: Commentary Box.]

<character>UECKER</character>
Would you look at that! College blernsball's 
finest female hitter making her big 
league debut against pro-ball's worst 
female anything! I've never seen anything 
this bizzare - and I've seen Mr Belvendere 
naked! Woo!

[Cut to: Pitch.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(quietly) Keep cool, she's just like 
any other player. She puts on her sports 
bra one arm at a time.

[She throws the ball and Jackie misses.]

<character>UMPIRE</character>
Strike one!

[The crowd gasps. Leela gasps.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Strike one - a personal best!

[She throws again.]

<character>UMPIRE</character>
Strike two!

[Leela and Jackie wipe their brows.]

[Cut to: Bleachers. Hermes wipes his brow with a sponge, and 
squeezes it into a file marked Ballpark Sweat.]

[Cut to: Pitch. Leela throws the ball, Jackie swings and hits 
it. The elastic tightens and breaks.]

[Cut to: Bleachers. The crowd look up and gasp. While they aren't 
looking Bender chuckles and steals some drinks from the people 
in front of him. Amy takes one too.]

[Cut to: Pitch. The now free ball flies through the air and into 
a target marked Hit It Here And Win The Game. The target lights 
up, a bell rings, Jackie runs around the pitch, the giant rats 
run out and the Slurm blimp crashes.]

[Cut to: Commentary Box.]

<character>UECKER</character>
A grand slam blern. The Mets lose, their 
season is over! And no question, Leela 
- the first woman ever to reach the 
majors will go down as the single worst 
player in the history of blernsball...!

[Cut to: Pitch. Leela walks sadly to the bench. Jackie jumps 
around with joy and the Boston players lift her up.]

<character>UECKER</character>
(voice-over) ...And yet tonight we have 
witnessed the beginning of a great career 
for the first woman to play the sport 
well - Jackie Anderson!

[Cut to: Tunnel. Leela walks away from the celebrations hanging 
her head in shame. Jackie pokes her head around the end of the 
tunnel.]

<character>JACKIE</character>
Leela?

[Leela turns around.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Jackie. I guess you were right, I'm 
a lousy role model. I'm sorry.

<character>JACKIE</character>
No, don't be. It turns out you were 
an inspiration afterall.

<character>LEELA</character>
(crying) I was?

<character>JACKIE</character>
Uh-huh. You were so awful that women 
everywhere set out to prove that they 
don't stink as bad as you. You know, 
like a pig or something.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh, that's so kind of you. I guess I 
made a difference afterall!

<character>JACKIE</character>
You absolutely did Leela. Now please, 
please retire! Immediately!

[She leaves. Leela looks at the towel around her neck.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Hey kid! Catch!

[Jackie turns around, Leela throws the towel and knocks Jackie 
over.]

[Blernsball Hall Of Fame: Worst Player In History Exhibit. Aaron 
Jr looks at a cardboard stand-up of Leela, standing where he 
used to sit. He sighs.]

<character>AARON SR</character>
Well, at least you're still the worst 
football player of all time.

<character>AARON JR</character>
Yeah. Yeah.

[He puts on his cap, turns out the lights and leaves.]
