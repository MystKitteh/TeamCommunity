[Opening Credits. Caption: Federal Law Prohibits Changing The 
Channel.]

[New New York City Street. Fry and Bender walk down a busy street 
and Bender sings and dances.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Froggy went a-courtin' and 
he did ride, uh-huh, uh-huh

Well, Froggy went a-courtin' and he did ride

Blah blah blah, something, Bender is great!

Froggy went a-courtin' and Bender is great, uh-huh -

[A rumbling noise interrupts his singing. He and Fry look through 
a gap in a fence and see Sal in a hover-digger digging a huge 
hole at the <character>NNYC</character> Hole Project. Sall dumps a load down on the 
ground. Amongst some rubble and mud is a bag of fat free potato 
chips. Fry picks it up.]

<character>FRY</character>
Oh my God! They dug up a bag of olestra 
chips from my time!  There must be layers 
and layers of old stuff down there.

[Sal dumps another scoop-ful and amongst the dirt is an entire 
VW minivan. Fry gasps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
What's that? One of those Led Zeppelins 
I've heard so much about?

[Fry puts his hands on the <character>VW</character>.]

<character>FRY</character>
No, it's an old Volkswagen van.  (shouting) 
Hey, Mister? Mind if I take this old 
van?

<character>SAL</character>
(shouting) Sure. You wanna dump the 
corpses out of theres, it's yourses.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah yeah, I've gotten used cars before.

[Planet Express: Hangar. Fry grunts and groans as he pushes the 
VW into the hangar. He is wearing the previous owner's bandana. 
Bender sits inside and guzzles down a beer. The rest of the crew 
gather around.]

<character>LEELA</character>
What's that? One of those Jefferson 
Starships I've heard so much about?

<character>FRY</character>
It's called a van, and in light of the 
fact that it's not a-rockin', I invite 
you to come a-knockin'!

[He slides open the door and the crew peer inside at all the 
beads and beanbags and throws.]

<character>AMY</character>
Wow, neat.

<character>HERMES</character>
It's a triumph of free-spirited German 
engineering.

<character>AMY</character>
Hey, the speedometer only goes up to 
80. This thing can't go faster than 
80,000 miles an hour?

<character>FRY</character>
No, it can't, but it's got a driver's-side 
floor and an 8-track player with genuine 
mono sound.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Where's the device that lets you speed 
or slow the passage of time?

<character>FRY</character>
Under the seat.

[He pulls out a bong. Leela tries turning the key in the ignition 
and the engine coughs and splutters.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Why won't it start?

<character>FRY</character>
It just needs some gas.

[Farnsworth puts his hand on his shoulder.]

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Wrong again, idiot. There is no gas. 
Petroleum reserves ran dry in 2038.

<character>LEELA</character>
Gas was an environmental disaster, anyway. 
Now we use alternative fuels.

<character>FRY</character>
Like what?

<character>LEELA</character>
Whale oil.  Bender, lift it up to the 
can opener.

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, no, I'm not going near it. Last 
time, that magnetic psycho nearly cut 
my head off.

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up 
your inhibition unit and makes you sing 
folk songs.

<character>BENDER</character>
What? Who said anything about me secretly 
wanting to be a folk singer? How ridiculous.

[He glances around. Fry puts his hand on his shoulder.]

<character>FRY</character>
Bender, if you don't open that can right 
now, your fear will own you, and nothing 
that can opener could ever do could 
be worse than that.

<character>BENDER</character>
OK, OK, I can do this. It's time to 
take life by the cans.

[He lifts the barrel and looks weakly at the others.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Come on.

<character>HERMES</character>
You can do it.

<character>AMY</character>
Bender!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Go on, you dummy.

[Bender walks towards the can opener and the magnet grabs him 
and starts cutting into him. Sparks fly from him and he starts 
to sing.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Jimmy cracked corn and I don't 
care

[He screams in pain.]

Jimmy cracked corn and I don't care...

[He screams again. The rest of the crew cringe and cover their 
eyes.]

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, no!

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) 'Cause the master's gone away.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
It's toe-tapping-ly tragic.

[Cedars-Sinewave Robot Hospital. Bender lies on a bed and a doctor 
checks him over. He has huge gashes across his chest.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Doc, I can't move my arms and legs. 
What's wrong with me?

[The doctor sighs.]

<character>DOCTOR</character>
This is the worst part of the job.

<character>BENDER</character>
What is it, good news?

<character>DOCTOR</character>
Bender, your hydraulics are shot. You'll 
never move again.

[Bender chokes.]

<character>BENDER</character>
You mean -?

[The doctor turns to Farnsworth.]

<character>DOCTOR</character>
I'm sorry, you'll have to get a new 
one.

[He leaves and Bender bursts into tears. The crew murmur to each 
other.]

<character>FRY</character>
Oh, no, this is terrible.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Poor Bender.

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
Well, let's drag him to the kerb.

[He grabs Bender's arm and Zoidberg takes hold of his legs. Fry 
stops them.]

<character>FRY</character>
Wait a minute, Bender is my best friend. 
We can't just dump him in the gutter 
like Grandma's ashes.

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) Oh, my life is over. I'll never 
know happiness again.

[A horn honks and robot on wheels dressed like a clown rolls 
in.]

<character>ROBOT</character>
Ho ho, hello there!

<character>LEELA</character>
Look, Bender. It's Patch Cord Adams. 
He heals with the power of laughter.

[He holds a robot-shaped balloon above Bender.]

<character>PATCH CORD ADAMS</character>
C'mon, take it. What's the matter, can't 
move your arms?

<character>BENDER</character>
Obviously not, or I'd be strangling 
you right now.

<character>PATCH CORD ADAMS</character>
Hey, here's a giggle!  Did you hear 
why they're using Windows 3000 as a 
prison guard?

<character>FRY</character>
No, why?

<character>PATCH CORD ADAMS</character>
'Cause it always locks up.

[The others laugh weakly.]

<character>BENDER</character>
For the love of God, somebody kick his 
ass!

<character>PATCH CORD ADAMS</character>
Well, so long. Get well soon.  Oh, well, 
so long anyway.

[He rolls out and Bender groans.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh, I'm doomed. Everybody leave me alone. 
I don't wanna be seen this way.

[Everyone, except Fry, leaves.]

<character>FRY</character>
Aw, you look so sad. You want me to 
send Patch Cord Adams back in?

[Bender bawls and Fry leaves. The sound of a harmonica stops 
his tears.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, the blues. The tragic sound of 
other people suffering. That's kind 
of a pick-me-up.  Wow, that was great.

<character>BECK</character>
Hey, thanks. You a fan?

<character>BENDER</character>
I dunno. Let me see.  Oh my God, you're 
Beck! I'd get up to shake your hand 
and steal your wallet but my crappy 
body crapped out on me.

<character>BECK</character>
Don't take it so hard. I used to miss 
my body too but then I fished this manequin 
out of the 92c Store dumpster.

<character>BENDER</character>
Wow. We've sure got a lot in common, 
Beck. I always dreamed of being a musician-poet 
who transcends genres even as he re-invents 
them, just like you.

<character>BECK</character>
So do it, robot. It's easier than it 
looks.

<character>BENDER</character>
Eh, thanks, but it's hopeless. I'll 
never be a musician now.

<character>BECK</character>
Or maybe you'll be the best musician 
ever.

[He motions the doctor to him and whispers something to him. 
He takes the harmonica holder out of Beck's jar and puts it around 
Bender's neck.]

<character>BENDER</character>
What's this for?

<character>BECK</character>
Try and scrape it across your chest 
like a knife on burnt toast.  Come on, 
move those arms. Use the power of mental 
thinking. Make it dynamic.  Yeah-ee! 
Alright, congratulations my friend.

<character>BENDER</character>
Why? 'Cause I can make annoying noises?

<character>BECK</character>
Exactly. I use those all the time in 
my music. Bender, I want you to become 
my new washboard player.

[Bender gasps.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Alright!  Go Bender! Go Bender! Go Bender!

[Outside Planet Express. The whole crew are gathered outside 
the building by the side of the road. Fry, still wearing his 
headband, wheels Bender out on a sack truck. He has a small green 
suitcase with him. A large blue bus pulls up and honks its horn.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, that's my good friend, Beck. I'm 
of to rock a series of mid-level venues.

<character>HERMES</character>
Kudos, Bender. You got mangled and now 
you're a singer. Both our dreams came 
true.

[The bus honks again.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram 
in my van and follow Bender on tour 
and live there, in the van?

[Behind them, the VW rumbles and backfires.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Oh, I don't know, Fry. I think I'm too 
poor to follow a band around in a van.

[The bus beeps again and Beck leans out of a window.]

<character>BECK</character>
(shouting) Come on, move it! We gotta 
get to the concert and make the audience 
wait for it at the start.

[Montage The tour bus passes under the Holland Tunnel with the 
VW right behind it, causing a tailback. They drive from New New 
York, through New New Jersey, Washington <character>A</character>.C., East West Virginia 
to a little town called Squatter's Corner in West Virginia.]

[Velma Sue's Laundromat. Zoidberg, Amy, Leela and Fry do their 
laundry. Zoidberg dumps the basket of washing on a table in front 
of the others who sit around in their underwear.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Bad news, friends. My shell ran.

[He holds up his clothes. They are a funky tie-dye pink.]

<character>AMY</character>
Zoidberg, you idiot, my outfit. It's, 
it's -

<character>LEELA</character>
Kinda cool.

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, I like it.

<character>AMY</character>
Me too, now that I'm used to it.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Then it was all on purpose. You're lucky 
to have Zoidberg as a friend. But cross 
me, and I'll turn on you like that.

[He snaps his fingers and squeals at them.]

[Squatter's Corners Civic Audeetorium. Beck and the band play 
their gig to some hicks in a barn. They perform Where It's At 
from the album Odelay.]

<character>BECK</character>
(singing) There's a destination a little 
up the road

From the habitations and the towns we know

A place we saw the lights turn low

The jigsaw jazz and the get-fresh glow

Pullin' out jives and jamboree handouts

Two turntables and a microphone

Bottles and cans just clap your hands just clap your hands.

<character>ALL</character>
(singing) Where it's at!

[Bender scrapes his chest.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(electric voice) Got a washboard stomach 
and a microphone.

[He scrapes his chest.]

<character>BECK</character>
That was a washboard break.

[The Planet Express foursome cheer.]

<character>FRY</character>
Oh yeah!

<character>AMY</character>
Yeah!  One bowl of Jell-O knuckles, 
please.

<character>BARMAN</character>
That'll be three pick-e-tures of George 
Washington.

[Amy takes some money out of her pocket but it has turned to 
green gloop.]

<character>AMY</character>
Oh no, my beautiful money.

<character>LEELA</character>
It got ruined in the wash.

[She and Fry take money out of their pockets.]

<character>FRY</character>
Mine too, even my change.

<character>BARMAN</character>
Get lost you money-less hippies!

[He holds up a picture of nine aliens.]

[Outside Squater's Corners Civic Audeetorium. After the concert, 
the band's gear is packed away in the bus.]

<character>BECK</character>
Bender, that was the best 40-minute 
washboard solo I've ever heard. And 
the parts when I was awake blew my mind.

[Bender hears something and turns around and sees some broken 
robots in some bins, rolling towards a building.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoa, check out all those broken robots. 
Howdy, fellas!

[He waves.]

<character>ROBOT #1</character>
I don't believe my broken eyes, it's 
Bender, the washboard player! Hey man, 
we caught your concert from here.

<character>ROBOT #2</character>
You rock!

<character>FEMBOT</character>
Oh, oh, Bender! Sign my chest!

<character>ROBOT #3</character>
Yo, brother, thanks for showing us broken 
robots are still useful.

<character>BENDER</character>
Aw, hang in there, folks. I'll bet before 
you know it, you guys'll be -  That 
is so wrong. They can't just melt down 
broken robots. Not right when they're 
kissing my ass.

<character>BECK</character>
Whoa, dog. Just cold chill.  You know, 
when I'm upset, I write a song about 
it. Like when I wrote Devil's Haircut, 
I was feeling really...what's that song 
about?

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey, yeah, I could write a song! With 
real words, not phony ones like "odelay".

<character>BECK</character>
"Odelay" is a word. Just look it up 
in the Becktionary.

[He holds the Webster's Abridged Becktionary (From Bzooty to 
Whiskeyclone).]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ooh!

[Beck's Bus. The bus drives down a desert road with the VW behind 
it. Inside, Beck lies on a settee while Bender and writes.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm working on my song. Hand me the 
Becktionary.  No, no, the rhyming Becktionary.

[Beck sighs.]

<character>BECK</character>
I wish I could help raise awareness 
about broken robots. But what can I 
do? I only weigh eight pounds.

<character>BENDER</character>
Wait a minute, you know lots of rock 
stars, and most of them like to look 
as though they care about things!

<character>BECK</character>
We can all get together for a big benefit 
concert in San Francisco!

<character>BENDER</character>
And we could call it "Bend-Aid", after 
me, Bender!

<character>BECK</character>
And you can sing that song you're writing!

<character>BENDER</character>
And I'll let you sing backup! But remember 
who the star is. Me: Bender.

[Montage The bus passes through several more states as Bender 
tries to come up with a song. He dabs his eyes with a tissue 
as he reads the song. At another concert, Fry, Zoidberg, Amy 
and Leela rummage through dustbins for food. Fry finds a hotdog 
with mustard and flies and holds it up to the others. Zoidberg 
cuts it up into four pieces and they eat it. They arrive in San 
Francisco at dusk.]

[Sir Francis Drake Hotel. Bender sits on a bed in his hotel room, 
writing his song.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Alright. "Hands in the air" rhymes with 
"Just don't care" and...finished!  Eck! 
Smells like something died in the wall!

[Fry, Leela, Zoidberg and Amy walk in.]

<character>FRY</character>
Surprise!

<character>LEELA</character>
Mind if we crash here tonight? The colours 
in the van are keeping us awake.

<character>BENDER</character>
Alright, but hands off the minibar.

[He closes his chest cabinet which has the minibar in it. Fry 
looks at the <character>TV</character>.]

<character>FRY</character>
Wow, I forgot about <character>TV</character>. Living free 
on the road, you realise how much better 
life is without it. Well, let's see 
what's on.

[He turns it. An advertisment comes on and shows a band playing 
on stage.]

<character>ANNOUNCER #1</character>
(voice-over; on TV) Tuesday, Golden 
Gate Park, the monsters of vaguely folkish 
alterna-rock will strum your brains 
out at Bend-Aid! Featuring Beck, Wailing 
Fungus and special guest, Bender!

<character>ANNOUNCER #2</character>
(voice-over; on TV) A portion of the 
proceeds might go to help broken robots.

[Everyone cheers.]

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Hooray, robot!

<character>AMY</character>
Bender, you're famous!

[Bender wipes away a tear.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah.

<character>LEELA</character>
This coming together of superstars really 
means a lot to you, doesn't it, Bender?

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) Uh-huh. Helping my defective 
brothers is the first thing I've ever 
cared about, even the slightest bit. 
You know, when I first got broken, I 
thought my life was over. But look at 
me now. I've got fame, money, groupies, 
and it's all thanks to being completely 
immobolised.  That's why I'll be proud 
to go up on stage, tomorrow, and say, 
"Look at me, world, I am a broken robot!".

<character>FRY</character>
Bender, you can move! You're cured!

[Bender looks at himself in a mirror.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh crap, it's a miracle.

[Time Lapse.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I can move again. (crying) My music 
career is over.

<character>FRY</character>
Bender, I don't claim to understand 
"the biz" but wouldn't being able to 
move help your music career?

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) No, don't you see? I was a 
hero to broken robots 'cause I was one 
of them. But how can I sing about being 
damaged if I'm not? That's like Christina 
Aguilera singing in Spanish.  Wait, 
that's it. I'll fake it!

[San Francisco Street. Fry drives the van down the winding streets, 
with a cloud of exhaust following it.]

[Cut to: <character>VW</character>. Zoidberg coughs and hawks into a tissue.]

<character>AMY</character>
You'd better not do that at the concert.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
I can't stop. When I eat too much dirt, 
I get stuff in my throat.

[He hawks and spits into the tissue.]

<character>AMY</character>
You are so disgusting, I -

[She gasps. Zoidberg has spit up blue pearls. Leela takes a handful.]

<character>LEELA</character>
They're beautiful.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Eww, you're touching them.

<character>AMY</character>
I've never seen pearls like this. Dr. 
Zoidberg, you're amazing.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
I am? At last! Recognition!

[He spits up some more into Amy and Leela's hands.]

[Golden Gate Park. Hundreds of hippies and broken robots have 
turned out for Bend-Aid.]

<character>EMCEE</character>
Gentle-hippies, put your filthy hands 
together for the folk stylings of Cylon 
and Garfunkel!

[A robot with a guitar and man who looks like Art Garfunkel walk 
onto the stage.]

<character>GARFUNKEL</character>
Here's a song that was beautiful when 
it was performed by my ancestor, Art.

[He starts to sing Scarborough Fair.]

(singing) Are you going to Scarborough Fair?

[Cylon cuts in with a mechanical voice.]

<character>CYLON AND GARFUNKEL</character>
(singing) Parsley, sage, rosemary and 
thyme.

<character>GARFUNKEL</character>
(singing) Remember me to one who loves 
there,

<character>CYLON AND GARFUNKEL</character>
(singing) She once was a true love of 
mine.

[The VW pulls up behind the crowd and the crew get out. They 
look around and the hippies sitting and lying on the grass.]

<character>LEELA</character>
We're home.

<character>AMY</character>
Well, let's earn some bread.

[Time Lapse. Amy puts a sign on the window that says "Genuine 
Love Beads, $5.00". Fry and Leela are holding some of Zoidberg's 
pearls that have been strung together.]

<character>FRY</character>
Brothers and sisters, get your love 
beads. Can't journey to the centre of 
your mind without love beads!

[Hippies gather around the van.]

<character>HIPPIE #1</character>
Wow, look at these colours. These'll 
go great with my soul.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Glad you like them. I've been making 
fine jewellery for years, apparently.

<character>HIPPIE #2</character>
I'll take three.

<character>HIPPIE #3</character>
Give me one, man!

<character>HIPPIE #4</character>
I'll trade you a bad poem!

[Time Lapse.]

<character>EMCEE</character>
And now, stand up and turn on your 
hidden tape recorders for...Beck! With 
special guest, Bender the broken robot.

[The stage curtain lifts and Bender and Beck are lowered from 
the ceiling. Broken robots in the audience cheer and the band 
plays Sexx Laws from the album Midnite Vultures.]

<character>FRY</character>
(shouting) Bender rules!

<character>HIPPIE #5</character>
Groove on, man!

<character>LEELA</character>
Rock it, Bender!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Play that thing!

[Bender and Beck hit the stage and liquid spills out of Beck's 
jar.]

<character>BECK</character>
(shouting) Can't you hear those cavalry 
drums

Hijacking your equilibrium...

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoa-oh, yeah!

<character>BECK</character>
(shouting) ...Midnight hags in the mausoleum...

[Time Lapse. Day has turned to dusk, the crowd has thinned and 
the band is still playing the same song. Bender scrapes his chest 
and the song ends. The crowd cheers.]

<character>BECK</character>
Thank you. That song doesn't usually 
last three hours, but we got into a 
serious thing...and then I forgot how 
it ended. Anyway, one last item of business 
before we go.

[Cylon and Garfunkel walk onto the stage with a big cheque.]

<character>GARFUNKEL</character>
Bender, to start your foundation for 
broken robots, here's a big cardboard 
cheque for $14,000.

<character>CYLON</character>
It's been an emotional day for me.

[They prop it up next to Bender, who starts to cry.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(crying) I don't know what to say.

<character>BECK</character>
Then maybe you should sing it. Lay it 
down boys.

[The band starts to play Bender's song and the lights dim.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Ladies, gentlemen, smoking heaps of 
machinery......this is a song called 
My Broken Friend.

[The crowd cheers.]

(singing) People say my broken friend is useless

But I say his mind is free

There's lots of things my mangled robot friend could be

<character>BECK</character>
Kick it!

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) He could make a good...

<character>BENDER AND BECK</character>
(singing) ...hatrack

<character>BECK</character>
(singing) He only has to stand there

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Or a cheap...

<character>BENDER AND BECK</character>
(singing) ...doorstop

<character>BECK</character>
(singing) He doesn't need to move

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Or a great big...

<character>BENDER AND BECK</character>
(singing) ...giant Thermos

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) With a twist-off top

<character>BECK</character>
(singing) That would be good for soup

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) He could be a storage closet...

<character>BENDER AND BECK</character>
(singing) ...For outdated pants

<character>BECK</character>
I like 'em tight!

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) My broken friend could do 
it all...

<character>BENDER AND BECK</character>
(singing) ...Just give him a chance!

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) That robot has a tragic secret

That I'd like to share...

<character>BECK</character>
For real?

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) ...My broken friend is closer 
to me

Than an ass to a chair...

<character>BECK</character>
Hm.

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) ...That robot's name I never 
told you...

<character>BECK</character>
Who's that?

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) ...You could not foresee...

<character>BECK</character>
C'mon, give it up.

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) ...I'll say it loud and sing 
it proud...

<character>BENDER AND BECK</character>
(singing) His name is you and me.

[Bender starts dancing.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Don't melt me down into a 
crowbar

<character>BECK</character>
(singing) It suffers alone

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Just 'cause I can't move my 
arms and legs

<character>BECK</character>
Hey.

[The robots look around and Bender flails his arms and legs around.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Or toss me into a trash can...

<character>BECK</character>
Bender, what are you doing?

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) ...Just 'cause I can't cook 
you ham and eggs...

<character>BECK</character>
What are you doing?

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) ...Don't crush me into an 
anchor...

<character>BECK</character>
What's the dealy-o?

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) ...Just 'cause I can't jump 
and dance and sing...

<character>BECK</character>
Hold it! What? No!

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) ...I'm telling you, my broken 
friend...

<character>BECK</character>
B-Bender.

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) ...Put your hands in the air 
like you just don't care!

<character>BECK</character>
No!

[Bender bounds off across the stage.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) I'm telling you, my broken 
friend...

<character>BECK</character>
Cut it!

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) ...Can do 'most anything!

[He slides across the stage on his knees.]

<character>BECK</character>
Cut it!

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah!

<character>BECK</character>
Cut it!

[The crowds shouts and boos. Bender's harmonica holder falls 
off. He looks at himself.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Curse my natural showmanship!

<character>ROBOT #1</character>
(shouting) You big fat fraud! You're 
not really broken!

<character>ROBOT #2</character>
(shouting) But you will be in a minute! 
Bum-rush the stage!

[The broken robots crawl and hobble towards Bender. Bender backs 
away.]

<character>ROBOT #3</character>
Get him!

[Bender folds the cheque away into his chest cabinet, grabs a 
rope and swings over the crowd, screaming like Tarzan. He flies 
towards the <character>VW</character>.]

[Cut to: <character>VW</character>. He flies through sunroof, slams his head against 
it and lands in the driver's seat. He shifts it into gear and 
speeds off in a cloud of smoke. The others hang on.]

[Cut to: Golden Gate Park.]

<character>HIPPIE #6</character>
Oh harsh, I didn't get my beads.

[Zoidberg coughs and beads rain down on the hippies. Beck watches 
from the stage.]

<character>BECK</character>
You, minion, lift up my arm.  After 
him!

[His bus pulls up and he gets on with Cylon and Garfunkel, the 
heads of Neil Young and Joni Mitchell, and Wailing Fungus. The 
bus ploughs through a crowd and a chase sequence lifted from 
Bullit begins.]

[San Francisco Street. The VW flies down the road, pursued by 
Beck's bus.]

[Cut to: <character>VW</character>. Bender looks in the rear-view mirror.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Well everyone, prepare to get your guts 
kicked out by folk singers.

[Cut to: San Francisco Street. The buses drive past a green VW 
Beetle once, twice, three times, four times...]

[Cut to: Chinatown. A Chinese street parade is interrupted as 
the buses drive past, blowing the Chinese dragon off a caterpillar-like 
alien.]

<character>CATERPILLAR ALIEN</character>
What is this? The Year of the Jerk?

[The VW rounds another corner, carving up another green Beetle.]

[Cut to: <character>VW</character>.]

<character>FRY</character>
Hurry, the Golden Gate Bridge. Put the 
metal to the pedal to the other metal.

[Bender floors it. Beck's bus gets closer and bumps them. They 
scream. The bus passes a sign that reads "Golden Gate Hoverbridge".]

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh no, I forgot this is a hoverbridge.

<character>LEELA</character>
And I forgot this isn't a hovercar.

<character>FRY</character>
Is any of that a problem?

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Not if you've lived a life without regret.

[He screams. The VW flies off the edge of the road and plummets 
to the ground below.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I'll save me!

[He leans out of the window and grabs a cable.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Quick, grab his footcups.

[They all grab Bender's feet.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Hey? What? No.

[The VW lands softly on a rocky outcrop by the water. Bender 
has pulled the wire and it is very tense.]

<character>FRY</character>
Phew!

[They all let go of Bender and the tense wire launches him into 
the air. The gang watch him fly off. Leela shrugs.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Bummer.

[Fisherman's Worf. The fat guy from the Titanic and a thin woman 
buy some food from Tarty McTang's and hear Bender screaming from 
above.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(shouting) Someone fat get in my way! 
(talking) Ah, I'm broken again. I can't 
move any part of me.

<character>BECK</character>
Good.

<character>BENDER</character>
I'm really sorry I lied, Beck. All I 
ever wanted was to make music with you. 
I never meant to hurt anyone, or help 
anyone.

<character>BECK</character>
Bender, that's some played-out, new-jack, 
horsecrap. But I know you don't mean 
it so, apology accepted.

<character>BENDER</character>
So, I can, uh, keep the cheque?

<character>GARFUNKEL</character>
Over my dead career!

[He takes the cheque out of Bender's chest cabinet.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Well, it was worth a shot.

[He gets up and the other three leave.]

[Time Lapse. The bus flies away and Bender sighs. The VW floats 
past. Fry, Leela, Amy and Zoidberg are paddling up the river 
in it. A seal sits on the roof.]

<character>FRY</character>
(shouting) C'mon, Bender. If you're 
done scamming Beck, we're heading home.

<character>BENDER</character>
Alright, alright. Let me just do one 
thing to cheer myself up.

[He takes a magnet from Ye Olde Tourist Trappe and puts it on 
his head. His pupils go wild and he starts to sing.]

Fry cracked corn

And I don't care

Leela cracked corn

I still don't care

Bender cracked corn

And he is great!

Take that you stupid corn!

[He wades out into the water to the <character>VW</character>.]
