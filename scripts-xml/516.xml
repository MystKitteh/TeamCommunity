[Opening Credits. Caption: See You On Some Other Channel. Above 
the caption Fry, Bender and Leela are heroes in an oval.]

[Fry and Bender's Lounge. It's the middle of the night. A bad 
rendition of The Grumpy Snail comes from Fry's room. Bender, 
wearing pyjama trousers, pokes his head around the corner from 
his room.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Huh?  I choose to not understand these 
signs.

[He puts his hand on the doorknob and turns it.]

[Cut to: Fry's Bedroom. The door opens and Bender sees Fry sat 
on his bed playing the holophonor. The green holographic smoke 
snakes upwards from it but he can't form a picture.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Aha!

[Fry quickly hides the holophonor behind him.]

<character>FRY</character>
Bender?? I was just not playing the 
holophonor.

[He wafts the smoke away with his hand.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah well you should try not stinking 
at it.

<character>FRY</character>
I am trying. (ashamed) I've been taking 
lessons.

<character>BENDER</character>
Lessons? Oh that's rich! Isn't it time 
you gave up all hope of ever improving 
yourself in any way?

<character>FRY</character>
I know I should but I just can't. Remember 
when I had those stomach worms that 
made me smart? I could play the holophonor 
and it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, 
as long as you know, I have a holophonor 
recital Tuesday and I'd really like 
to have somebody there. Please?

[Bender sighs.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Fine I'll go already. Y'know sometimes 
I wish your real parents were still 
alive...not often.

[He and Fry hug.]

[Outside Holophonor School. The sign reads "Holophonor Teacher. 
Taking The Joy Out Of Music For 20 Years." Fry and Bender ride 
some Segways on the pavement and Fry crashes his into Bender's.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Whoa...hey!

[Holophonor School. The room is decorated like an old woman's 
home, being as the teacher herself is an old woman. A mother 
straightens her son's hair and the teacher approaches Fry and 
Bender with a tray.]

<character>FRY</character>
Uh...hello Mrs Mellenger.

<character>MRS MELLENGER</character>
Hello Philip.  And you must be Mr Bender. 
Philip's told me so much about you. 
Is it true that you're a robot?

<character>BENDER</character>
I prefer the term "love machine."

[He growls sexfully.]

[Time Lapse. Everyone sits down and watches the kid with the 
untidy hair play Beethoven's Fï¿½r Elise on his holophonor. The 
holographic smoke whirls around and forms a picture of an elegantly 
dressed man and woman. The man plays an open grand piano and 
the woman sits on it. Some steps fly around the back of the man 
and the woman gets up and walks up them. The man follows her 
as they climb into the clouds. A barrel rolls under them and 
scores 100 points for each like in the Donkey Kong game. The 
audience applauds. Bender leans over to the kid's mother.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Wow, your kid is great. How hard did 
you say you had to hit him?

<character>MOTHER</character>
Fairly hard.

[Fry puts My First Holophonor on the music stand. He flips through 
it, sits down and clears his throat.]

<character>FRY</character>
The...Grumpy Snail.  Sorry.

[He carries on playing then starts playing badly. The snail turns 
into a slimy, salivating beast and starts growling at the audience. 
They scream.]

<character>KID</character>
(crying) It's too grumpy!

[A man screws up a piece of paper and throws it at Fry. More 
people throw paper at Fry and the snail disappears.]

<character>FRY</character>
Ow! No! Quit it! Stop it!

[Bender stands up, applauds and cheers. The audience stares at 
him.]

<character>MRS MELLENGER</character>
Mr Bender, I simply can not teach your 
child.

<character>BENDER</character>
Then good day madam!  We hope to see 
you soon for tea.

[Planet Express: Lounge. Bender and Fry sit at the table with 
the holophonor.]

<character>FRY</character>
It's hopeless. I can hear all this great 
music in my head but my stupid hands 
can't keep up.

<character>BENDER</character>
Aww, you know what always cheers me 
up? Laughing at other people's misfortunes.

[He laughs at Fry's misfortune. Enter Leela with a clipboard.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Hey guys, you missed a great delivery 
to Space Earth. Where you been all afternoon?

<character>FRY</character>
Uh...a concert.

<character>LEELA</character>
Ooo was it jazz-noodling? My ex-boyfriend 
Sean played the sax. I used to listen 
for hours while he sat naked on my couch 
and improvised.

<character>BENDER</character>
So musicians really Rodger your Hammerstein 
huh?

<character>LEELA</character>
Yeah, it's weird. Sean was uneducated, 
unambitious. He was pastey and hunched...

<character>FRY</character>
(quietly) Pretty boy.

<character>LEELA</character>
...But when he played I could sense 
this incredible, beautiful creative 
soul. Then one day I found someone else's 
couch fibres on his butt.

[She walks out into the meeting room, muttering to herself. The 
door closes behind her and Fry stands up from the table.]

<character>FRY</character>
It could be my beautiful soul sitting 
naked on her couch if I could just learn 
to play this stupid thing.

[Bender stands up.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh but you can. Although you may have 
to metaphorically make a "deal with 
the devil." And by "devil" I mean "Robot 
Devil." And by "metaphorically" I mean 
"get your coat."

[Robot Hell. Hellbots torture damned robots in the burning cave 
underneath The Inferno and they scream in pain. Beelzebot and 
his band of Hellbots practice the Robot Hell song. He plays his 
golden fiddle and then suddenly stops.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
God, you hit a sour note about 200 years 
back Doug!  Let's take it from the top. 
Ah Bender, Fry. You've come back for 
more eternal damnation.

[Bender stands up and dust himself off.]

<character>BENDER</character>
No, this isn't a religious visit. Fry 
just wants holophonor lessons.

[Fry stands up.]

<character>FRY</character>
Yep. I need to get really good without 
practicing.

[The Robot Devil cackles evilly.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Hell is full of ten year olds who wanted 
exactly the same thing. Trouble is, 
you have what my old music teacher Mrs 
Mellenger called "stupid fingers."  
With hands like that you'll be lucky 
to master a belt buckle.  Now wouldn't 
it be nice if you had a pair of robot 
hands to replace them?

<character>FRY</character>
Sure it would.  Oh well. Goodbye.

[He turns around and Bender stops him.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Fry you smelly idiot, I think he's willing 
to make some kind of deal with the devil 
with you.

<character>FRY</character>
He is?  Great! Wait, what's the catch?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at 
random from somewhere in the universe 
- probably one you've never even met 
- and then I'll remove his hands and 
switch them for yours.  It's just the 
sort of guy I am, what do you say?

<character>FRY</character>
I don't know. It doesn't seem entirely 
moral to -

<character>BENDER</character>
Fry if you don't take this offer right 
now I will lose all respect for you 
and punch you.

[The Robot Devil giggles and drums his fingers on the huge Wheel 
Of Robots in anticipation of Fry's decision.]

<character>FRY</character>
Well...alright. You sure I probably 
won't know him?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Definitely probably not.  Just sign 
this contract.

<character>BENDER</character>
Wow.

[Fry signs the contract and the Robot Devil pulls it away from 
him.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
And here we go!

[He spins the huge wheel and cackles insanely.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I got a hundred bucks on Rectal-Exambot!

[They watch as the wheels cycles through hundreds of robots. 
It begins to slow down. The arrow passes Emotitron Jr from Bender 
Should Not Be Allowed On TV, Ceiling Fan from Mother's Day and 
Hookerbot from Hell Is Other Robots. It reaches "Bender" and 
slows down even more and just manages to pass it, finally coming 
to rest on "Robot Devil." The Robot Devil screams.]

<character>FRY</character>
Robot Devil? I get your hands? Zam!

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Oh what an appallingly ironic outcome.

<character>BENDER</character>
It's not ironic it's just coincidental. 
Now fork over those lady-fingers cookie!

[Fry holds out his hands and the Robot Devil sighs. He takes 
a meat cleaver out of his chest cabinet.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Y'know I only put my name on there as 
a show of good faith for the other robots.

<character>FRY</character>
Stop being such a baby and chop my hands 
off.

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Oh very well.

[He very quickly chops and swaps Fry's and his hands. Fry looks 
at his new hands.]

<character>FRY</character>
(impressed) How'd you do that?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
They're very good hands.

[Fry flexes his new fingers.]

<character>FRY</character>
At last! At last I have the power to 
make Leela love me.

[The hands grab his around the throat and start to choke him.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Oh sorry, that'll wear off in a couple 
of days.

[He looks at his new hands and Fry falls to the floor, still 
choking.]

[Planet Express: Meeting Room. Next morning Farnsworth, Hermes, 
Leela, Amy, Zoidberg and Bender are sat around the table. Enter 
Fry.]

<character>FRY</character>
Check it out everyone. I'm back from 
hell and I've got the Robot Devil's 
hands!

<character>AMY</character>
Neat! Let's see a trick.

<character>FRY</character>
Alrighty!

[He spins off Bender's head and starts to completely dismantle 
him. Then he starts juggling the pieces. Bender panics as he 
juggles. Enter Scruffy.]

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Somebody called the Robot Devil's here 
to see somebody called Fry.

<character>FRY</character>
Uh-oh.

[He quickly puts Bender back together and runs out.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Where'd I go just now?

[Planet Express: Entrance. Fry walks into the foyer where the 
Robot Devil is already standing.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Hello Fry.  Just dropped by to make 
sure you're as happy with our little 
deal as I am.  Give me back my hands! 
These things are always touching me 
in places.

[Fry chuckles.]

<character>FRY</character>
Yeah, they get around! But I'm afraid 
we had a deal.

[The Robot Devil groans.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
It looks like I wasted a bus trip.

<character>FRY</character>
Yes you did.

[Montage Later that night Fry sits in his bedroom playing The 
Grumpy Snail much better than before. The next day he plays Beethoven's 
Fï¿½r Elise to Mrs Mellenger. Like the kid who played it before, 
the formally dressed man and woman dance. A formally dressed 
grumpy snail slides between them and the man dances with him 
instead. A barrel rolls down the steps and knocks the woman over. 
At Hovercar-Negie Hall Fry plays with a full orchestra to a captivated 
audience. His holo-dancers dance to the music and twist around 
the grumpy snail's eyestalks. The audience goes wild. From a 
balcony Leela watches with tears in her eyes. She applauds.]

[Planet Express: Lounge. There is an advertisement on TV presented 
by the grumpy snail. At the side of the screen is a picture of 
Fry in an oval holding his holophonor underneath "Fry's Greatest 
Holophonor Hits."]

<character>GRUMPY SNAIL </character>[ON TV]
Yes, now you can hear holophonor virtuoso 
Philip Fry play 900 of his classic themes 
in your own home on this two-record 
set.  That's over 30 minutes of music 
for only $14.99.

[Fry sits on the couch bored. Zoidberg picks up the phone and 
starts dialling.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
Only $14.99 for a two-record set. Two 
records! Oh Zoidberg, at last you're 
becoming a crafty consumer!  Hello? 
I'll take eight!

[The doorbell rings. Scruffy walks in from the meeting room and 
points back the way he came.]

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Mr Hedonismbot to see you.

<character>FRY</character>
Show him in.

<character>SCRUFFY</character>
Very good sir.

[He leaves. Enter Hedonismbot.]

<character>HEDONISMBOT</character>
Ah Fry, congratulations. Your latest 
performance was as delectable as dipping 
my bottom over and over into a bath 
of the silkiest oils and creams!

<character>FRY</character>
Thank you sir, that's exactly what I 
was going for.

<character>HEDONISMBOT</character>
You were the sole diversion in what 
has been a pale and unamusing season. 
And so I would feign commission you 
write an opera.

[He drops a bunch of grapes into his mouth.]

<character>FRY</character>
But, I've never written an opera.

<character>HEDONISMBOT</character>
And I've never heard one. Still, if 
you can keep me amused through the overture 
I shall consider it a smashing success.

<character>FRY</character>
But I wouldn't even know what to write 
about. Unless...  OK I'll do it. If 
I can make it about Leela.

[Leela stops eating and turns around.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Me? Really?

<character>HEDONISMBOT</character>
A man writing an opera about a woman? 
Oh sera, how deliciously absurd!  I 
shall see you at the premiere.

[He walks out the door, laughing.]

[Planet Express: Hangar. Late at night Leela hammers something 
inside the ship's port wing when she hears some music. She stops 
hammering and looks around.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Attic. Leela walks in trying to trace 
the sound. She sees holographic silhouettes coming from underneath 
a door like Bender did in the apartment.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Attic Balcony. Leela opens the door 
and sees Fry sat on the balcony playing the holophonor. In his 
image two stick figures dance. He stops playing and writes some 
notes on a music sheet.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Is it part of the opera?

[Fry turns around and quickly puts the holophoner down.]

<character>FRY</character>
Leela!  You shouldn't be listening. 
I-I don't want you to hear it 'til it's 
done.

<character>LEELA</character>
But it's so beautiful.

<character>FRY</character>
So's a peacock but you don't eat it 
'til it's cooked. This has to be perfect. 
I want you to hear exactly what I hear 
when I think about you.

<character>LEELA</character>
Oh Fry. All this time you've had this 
incredible gift and I never knew. I've 
been a fool. A fully justified prudent 
fool.  They're so cold.

<character>FRY</character>
(shouting) No!

[Planet Express: Kitchen. The next morning Bender wanders into 
the kitchen humming with a towel wrapped around his waist. He 
opens the fridge and screams. The Robot Devil leaps out of it.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Ah Bender, this is a surprise! For you. 
Finding me in the refrigerator.

<character>BENDER</character>
True but at least I don't have the hiccups 
anymore. What up?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Oh well it so happens I'm in the mood 
to make a deal with you.

[He puts his arms on Bender's shoulders but Bender pushes him 
away.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Forget it, you can't tempt me.

[He walks over and opens a cupboard.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(tempting) Really? There's nothing you 
want?

<character>BENDER</character>
Hm. I forgot you could tempt me with 
things I want.  Well, I suppose I've 
always wondered what it would be like 
to be more annoying.

[The Robot Devil chuckles.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Nothing simpler! And all I ask in return 
is you hands.  To replace these bony 
hotdogs!

<character>BENDER</character>
Grabby and Squeezy? Never! I love these 
guys!

[The Robot Devil groans.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Is there anything else you would part 
with?

<character>BENDER</character>
No, nothing ain't gonna happen.

[Time Lapse. The Robot Devil screws a huge white airhorn into 
Bender's nose slot.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Yes! With this built-in stadium airhorn 
I can really annoy people. And all it 
cost me was my crotchplate.

[He bends over, puts his hand in his chest cabinet and wiggles 
his hand between his legs.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
You certainly are a shrewd businessman 
Bender.  Now find someone and give 'em 
a good blast!

<character>BENDER</character>
Yeah, that'll teach the first person 
I see a lesson!

[He walks off.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Ah, my ridiculously circuitous plan 
is one-quarter complete!

[He cackles evily...again.]

[Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Amy is sat on the couch eating 
a buggalo leg. Leela puts her handbag on her shoulder.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Well, Fry's opera premiere's tomorrow 
night. I'm off to find a pair of formal 
gloves that'll fit over my enormous 
forearms.

[Cut to: Planet Express: Corridor. Leela walks through the door 
into the corridor between the lounge and meeting room and walks 
straight into Bender who blasts her with a blast from his airhorn. 
She holds her ears to block out the tremendous noise. Bender 
stops and laughs. The Robot Devil peeks around the corner from 
the meeting room.]

<character>BENDER</character>
Pretty annoying, huh Leela?

<character>LEELA</character>
(shouting) What? Are you talking? Oh 
God I'm deaf!

<character>BENDER</character>
Oops. I'm so so sorry Leela. I just 
wanted to annoy you.

<character>LEELA</character>
(shouting) What? Oh this is horrible. 
I won't be able to hear Fry's opera.

[She starts to cry. The Robot Devil stands at the end of the 
corridor watching them.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Ah how delightfully ironic.

<character>BENDER</character>
It's not ironic, it's just mean. Take 
this!

[He blows the airhorn weakly.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Ooh! Out of aerosol? Also ironic!

<character>BENDER</character>
Oh yeah? Well bite my shiny metal - 
(shouting) Oh nooo!

[Outside Metropolitan House Of Opera. It's premiere night. Fry 
has entitled his opera "Leela: Orphan Of The Stars."]

[Cut to: Metropolitan House Of Opera Auditorium. People stand 
on an upper level and wait for flying booths to carry them off 
to the upper gallery. The entire Planet Express crew except Fry 
sit a few rows back from the front wearing formal clothes.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Nobody tell Fry I'm deaf. If he found 
out I couldn't hear his opera, it'd 
break his heart.

<character>BENDER</character>
OK deafo.

[A booth carrying Hedonismbot and his servants flies over the 
stage.]

<character>HEDONISMBOT</character>
Courtesans and gentle fops. I bid you 
welcome to my opera.  Let us cavort 
like the Greeks of old. (sexfully) You 
know the ones I mean.

[The booth flies away and an orchestra plays. The lights dim, 
the orchestra stops and a spotlight follows Fry as he walks across 
the stage with his holophonor. The audience applauds and cheers.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Yay Fry!

[Zoidberg leans forward to some people in front.]

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
I watch TV with that guy!

[Fry bows and sits down. He starts to play. The smoke forms an 
image of a sign. "Scene 1. Wherein Leela Is Found At The Orphanarium." 
The holo-scene changes to the steps of Cookieville Minimum Security 
Orphanarium. The people are real actors with holographic costumes. 
A group of Holo-orphans watch as a Holo-Vogel steps out of the 
building and sees holo-Leela in a basket.]

<character>HOLO</character>-<character>VOGEL</character>
(singing) Who is this one-eyed female 
baby Moses?

With courage in her female baby smile.

<character>HOLO</character>-<character>ORPHANS</character>
(singing) A saviour from the stars,

Or something stranger still.

<character>HOLO</character>-<character>LEELA</character>
(singing) Or just some lonely filthy 
starving child.

[In the audience Leela leans to Amy.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Amy, Fry's looking at me. What am s'posed 
to be feeling?  Ah!

[She turns back to the stage with her face screwed up in sadness. 
Fry smiles and carries on playing.]

[Time Lapse. On the stage a big green Holo-Godzilla holds Holo-Fry 
in it's hands. Holo-Bender watches as Holo-Leela points a laser 
at it.]

<character>HOLO</character>-<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) Leela! Leela Leela save him!

Save Fry, save Fry,

Godzilla will devour him,

As for me,

I must be off,

To have my doctor check this cough!

[He coughs.]

Goodbye!

[He turns away but Godzilla slams his foot down and blocks his 
path. In the audience Bender watches with great interest.]

<character>BENDER</character>
I don't recall ever fighting Godzilla 
but that is so what I would have done.

[Metropolitan House Of Opera Bar. It's the intermission and the 
patrons are gathered outside the auditorium. Calculon and Preacherbot 
talk while Florp laughs at one of Humorbot 5.0's jokes. Amy and 
Hermes are at the bar.]

<character>AMY</character>
One diet double Martini please.

<character>BARTENDER</character>
And for you sir?

<character>HERMES</character>
I'll just have a Shirley Hemple.

[Tinny Tim wanders in with a newspaper, passing Leela who is 
standing by the coat room door.]

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
Extra! Extra! World's greatest opera 
only half over!

[Leela reads the headline.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Half over? Oh, I'd give anything to 
hear the rest.

[The coat door opens and Beelzebot is inside.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Anything?  Thank you sir.  Now, as I 
was saying, anything? Because I can 
give you new robotic ears!

[He points at his ears.]

<character>LEELA</character>
What? You can give me new ears? Wait, 
what seemingly reasonable thing do you 
want in return?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Just your hands my dear.

<character>LEELA</character>
Whatever you said, forget it!

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Alright, just one hand.

<character>LEELA</character>
Just...my left hand? Um...uh...

<character>ANNOUNCER</character>
Please take your seats for act two.

<character>HEDONISMBOT</character>
But I'm not done vomiting.

[He laughs. Leela looks at the people behind her.]

<character>LEELA</character>
I can't stand it!  <character>OK</character>. You can have 
my hand.

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Wonderful!  Just sign here.  Calculon 
old friend, I'm afraid I need your ears.

<character>CALCULON</character>
Well I do owe you for giving me this 
unholy (dramatically) acting talent!

[The Robot Devil takes Calculon's ears off his head and puts 
them into Leela's ears. She looks around and smiles.]

<character>LEELA</character>
I can hear! I can hear like a safecracker! 
Hey, aren't you gonna take my hand?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
In good time, you go enjoy the opera.

[Leela gives him a shifty look but runs back into the auditorium 
anyway.]

[Metropolitan House Of Opera Auditorium. Leela shuffles past 
the rest of the crew and sits back in her seat. Fry plays the 
scene in Robot Hell where the Robot Devil decided who's hands 
to give him. Holo-Fry sees Leela as a winged angel.]

<character>HOLO</character>-<character>FRY</character>
(singing) To win Leela's heart with 
the holophonor's art,

I need hands of transcendental quickness.

<character>HOLO</character>-<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) Well I don't see any danger,

In gambling with a stranger,

For my head is of a most amazing thickness.

[He spins the Wheel Of Robots and falls over. The audience laughs. 
At the back of the room the Robot Devil sees and growls. He stands 
up.]

I'm stupid, I'm stupid,

I'm stupider than you,

I'm stupider than you in every way!

[The real Robot Devil jumps onto the stage.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
Stupider? Pah! This opera's as lousy 
as it is brilliant!  Your lyrics lack 
subtlety. You can't just have your characters 
announce how they feel. That makes me 
feel angry.

<character>FRY</character>
Look, what do you want?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) I want my hands back.

[He laughs menacingly and columns of flame explode behind him. 
Fry stands up.]

<character>FRY</character>
Never!

(singing)A deal's a deal,

Even with a dirty dealer.

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) Very well,

Then I'll take what I want from Leela.

[The spotlight moves from the stage to Leela. Beelzebot extends 
his arms and pulls her from her seat onto the stage.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Whoa!

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) Leela has promised me her 
hand.

[The audience gasps.]

<character>LEELA</character>
(singing) Fry, you do not understand.

[The music slows down and the spotlight narrows as Leela walks 
across the stage.]

I should have revealed I've been deafened by Bender,

The shame,

The shaaame,

But I feared you'd stop writing this musical splendour,

Deception's the curse of my whimsical gender,

He gave me mechanical ears,

Effective though just a bit garish,

In return without shedding a tear I agreed that I'd give him 
my hand...

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) ...In marriage!

[Fry gasps.]

<character>LEELA</character>
What?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) You'd give me your hand in 
marriage.

[He gets down on one knee. The audience watches. Farnsworth watches 
through some opera glasses, though are just as thick as his normal 
ones.]

<character>HERMES</character>
(singing) Is this really happening or 
just being staged?

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(singing) It can't be real -

<character>AMY</character>
(singing) Not if Leela is engaged!

<character>LEELA</character>
(singing) That isn't what I meant,

That isn't what I signed.

[The Robot Devil takes the contract out of his chest cabinet.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) You should have checked the 
wording in the fine...  Print!

<character>LEELA</character>
(reading) I'll give you my hand...

[In the audience Bender reads from a dictionary.]

<character>BENDER</character>
(singing) The use of words expressing 
something other than their literal intention,

Now that is "irony!"

[The Robot Devil pulls Preacherbot out of his seat and onto the 
stage.]

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
(singing) I will marry her now and confine 
her to hell,

How droll,

How droll!

Where Styx is a river,

And not just a band,

Though they'll play our reception if all goes as planned,

Unless Fry you surrender my hands!

[Fry looks at the hands on his wrists. The spotlight narrows 
over him.]

<character>FRY</character>
(singing) Destiny has cheated me by 
forcing me to decide upon,

The woman that I idolise,

Or the hands of an automaton,

Without these hands I can't complete the opera that was captivating 
her,

But if I keep them,

And she marries him,

Then he probably won't want me dating her.

[The audience applauds and cheers. Nixon sits next to Morbo and 
wife.]

<character>NIXON</character>
Arooo!

[Zapp the linguist sits on a balcony with a date.]

<character>ZAPP</character>
Bray-vo! Enn-core!

<character>FARNSWORTH</character>
(singing) I can't believe the devil 
is so unforgiving.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(singing) I can't believe everyone is 
just ad-libbing!

[Leela struggles to get out of Beelzebot's hold but he is holding 
her too tightly. Fry gazes at his hands.]

<character>PREACHERBOT</character>
(singing) By the power vested in me,

By the state of New New York -

<character>FRY</character>
No!  Stop! Take my hands!

(singing) You evil metal dork!

[He falls to his knees and cries. The Robot Devil cackles, pulls 
out his cleaver and chops his hands off Fry's wrists. Leela gasps. 
The lights dim.]

<character>HEDONISMBOT</character>
Surgery in an opera? How wonderfully 
decadent and just as I was beginning 
to lose interest.  The chocolate icing! 
Oh my!

[The Robot Devil screws his hands back onto his wrists and Fry 
looks at his own.]

<character>FRY</character>
My hands. My horrible human hands.  
And what did you do to my nails?

<character>ROBOT DEVIL</character>
I cleaned them. Now if you'll excuse 
me it's my poker night and I feel lucky. 
So it's back to hell for me. Come on 
Nixon!

[He picks up Nixon's jar.]

<character>NIXON</character>
Huh?

[They vanish in a flash of smoke and flame. The audience murmur 
in confusion and don't notice the Robot Devil running out of 
the auditorium behind them.]

<character>HEDONISMBOT</character>
Less reality, more fantasy. Resume the 
opera.

<character>FRY</character>
But I can't play anymore.

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
(shouting) Yes you can. The beauty was 
in your heart, not your hands.  The 
music's bad and you should feel bad.

[The audience gets up and walks out, throwing paper at Fry along 
the way.]

<character>FRY</character>
Ah! Ooo, ah, whoa, hey!

[Outside Metropolitan House Of Opera. The audience flock out 
of the opera house. Tinny Tim has a new newspaper.]

<character>TINNY TIM</character>
(shouting) Extra! Extra! Greatest opera 
of all time sucks!

<character>ZOIDBERG</character>
I'll take eight!

[He hands Tinny Tim some money and picks up a pile of newspapers.]

[Metropolitan House Of Opera. Fry sits alone on the stage in 
the empty auditorium. He puts his holophonor on the floor and 
gets up to leave.]

<character>LEELA</character>
Please don't stop playing Fry. I wanna 
hear how it ends.

[Fry turns around. Leela is the only person left in the room. 
He smiles then sits down, picks up the holophonor and starts 
to play. The smoke whirls around above him and forms a crude 
cartoon-like image of him and Leela who turn to each other and 
take hold of one another's hand. They kiss, turn around and walk 
away towards the horizon, never taking their eyes off each other.]
