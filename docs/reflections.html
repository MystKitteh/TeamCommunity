        <h1>Into</h1>
        <p>We used several different data visualization softwares. These include: AntConc,SVG and
            seaborn via jupyter notebook.</p>
        <h2>AntConc</h2>
        <p>We made two visualizations with AntConc. One for the first episode and one for the last
            episode.
            AntConc is primarily designed for text analysis, so the types of visualizations we could generate were somewhat restricted. This meant we had to get creative to represent our data effectively.</p>
        <h3>SVG</h3>
        <p>We made two SVGs for the first and last season that we had data for. The main difficulty
            was figuring out how to recenter the text to appear on our site. </p>
        <h4>Seaborn</h4>
        <p>While Seaborn offers a high-level interface for creating attractive visualizations, we sometimes found ourselves limited by the library's built-in customization options. Achieving specific design or formatting requirements often required additional coding or workarounds.</p>
        <h5>conclusions</h5>
        <p>Despite these challenges, we were able to overcome them through collaboration, experimentation, and perseverance, ultimately producing insightful visualizations to support our project goals.</p>
