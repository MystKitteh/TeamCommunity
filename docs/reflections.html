        <h3>Intro</h3>
        <p>We used several different data visualization softwares. These include: AntConc, SVG and
            seaborn via jupyter notebook.</p>
        <h3>AntConc</h3>
        <p>We made two visualizations with AntConc. One for the first episode and one for the last
            episode. The main goal we had for these visualizations were to see what patterns changed
            or if any characters were mentioned less frequently as the show went on. AntConc is
            primarily designed for text analysis, so the types of visualizations we could generate
            were somewhat restricted. This meant we had to get creative to represent our data
            effectively.</p>
        <h3>SVG</h3>
        <p>We made two SVGs for the first and fifth season. We found the data using XPath for the
            each episode of season 1 and 5. There were a total of 25 episodes (9 for season 1 and 16
            for season 5). The goal of this comparison was to see if any characters had a change of
            frequency in dialogue. We found that Fry had more overall dialogue in both seasons when
            compared to Bender and Leela. All three character decreased their dialogue per episode
            by season 5. The main difficulty was figuring out how to recenter the text to appear on
            our site. The other difficulty was we had realized that season 1 and 5 had a different
            number of episodes which could account for why there Bender and Leela had increased
            dialogue. We averaged out the data instead to give more accurate results. </p>
        <h3>Seaborn</h3>
        <p>While Seaborn offers a high-level interface for creating attractive visualizations, we
            sometimes found ourselves limited by the library's built-in customization options.
            Achieving specific design or formatting requirements often required additional coding or
            workarounds.</p>
        <h3>HTML&amp;CSS</h3>
        <p>We created 5 html pages and 2 CSS pages. While our work with HTML and CSS ran relatively
            smooth, there were some issues that we faced.One issue that we faced was that on one our
            laptops the "Data" heading text was overlapping with some of the other text.We were able
            to fix this by having some of the CSS simplified. </p>
        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p>Despite these challenges, we were able to overcome them through collaboration,
            experimentation, and perseverance, ultimately producing insightful visualizations to
            support our project goals.</p>
