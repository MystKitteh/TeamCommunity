            <h2>Mistie</h2>
            <p>I'm a transfer student from Texas currently completing my senior year at Penn State Behrend.
                Exploring this project has been a nice throwback to one of my childhood favorites, Futurama.
                When I have spare time I enjoy playing video games, making art, reading, and hiking.</p>
            <h2>Samantha</h2>
            <p>I am a third year digit student double minoring in marketing and data visualization.
                I had not watched futurama before working on this project so learning about the
                characters and their quirks has been interesting to see. In my spare time, I enjoy
                reading and playing Stardew Valley.</p>
            <h2>Charlie</h2>
            <p>I'm a student in my second year as of now, transfered from a different commonwealth
                campus to psu behrend after changing my major to DIGIT. I was already familiar with
                futurama before working on the project and im a fan of the show. I hope to learn more
                about the adobe creative cloud offered in DIGIT and to get a career involving content
                creation. In my spare time I enjoy learning to play the guitar and working on my webcomic.</p>
