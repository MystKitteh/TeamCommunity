                <h3>Mistie Mcolm</h3>
                <p>I'm a transfer student from Texas currently completing my senior year at Penn State Behrend.
                   Exploring this project has been a nice throwback to one of my childhood favorites, Futurama.
                   When I have spare time I enjoy playing video games, making art, reading, and hiking.</p>
                <h3>Samantha Moniot</h3>
                <p>I am a third year digit student double minoring in marketing and data visualization.
                    I had not watched futurama before working on this project so learning about the
                    characters and their quirks has been interesting to see. In my spare time,I enjoy
                    reading and playing Stardew Valley.</p>
                <h3>Charlie Vazquez</h3>
                <p>Im a student in my second year as of now, transfered from a different commonwealth
                    campus to psu behrend after changing my major to DIGIT. I was already familiar with
                    futurama before working on the project and im a fan of the show. I hope to learn more
                    about the adobe creative cloud offered in DIGIT and to get a career involving content
                    creation. In my spare time I enjoy learning to play the guitar and working on my webcomic.</p>
                <h3>Tyler Dollard</h3>
                    <p> I’m Tyler Dollard, a third-year student at Penn State Behrend, passionate about delving into the world of digital media. From crafting films to creating short clips, I’ve always found joy in storytelling through visuals. My goal? To hone my skills and turn my passion into a fulfilling career. When I’m not immersed in media creation, you’ll likely find me enjoying my favorite TV shows, diving into video games for both leisure and competition, or hitting the field for some sports action. Life’s all about balancing creativity and play, and I’m here for every moment of it.</p>
